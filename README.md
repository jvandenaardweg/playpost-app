# Upgrading to new React Native version?
Use `react-native-git-upgrade`.

# Added manually
Below packages where added manually using the installation instructions. This required manually editting files. This should be taken into account when we upgrade React Native.

- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html)
- [React Native Share Extension](https://github.com/alinz/react-native-share-extension)


# Setting up build environment
Make sure the `.env`, `.env.staging` and `.env.production` files are filled with the right environment variables. Use the correct `ENVIRONMENT` environment variable:
- Staging: `ENVIRONMENT=staging`
- Production: `ENVIRONMENT=production`

A correct `.env` file is created upon build. See `appcenter-pre-build.sh`

# Troubleshooting
First, try to build from XCode. Open the `Playpost.xcworkspace` file (not the `'.xcodeproject`).

Clean the cache: `cmd + shift + k`
Start a build: `cmd + b`

## Undefined symbols for architecture arm64
When you get errors related to "Undefined symbols for architecture arm64 - JSClassCreate". Add the `JavaScriptCore.framework` on top of the `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` in the `PlaypostShareExtension` target.

## Several errors relating to React imports
When you get build errors about missing imports with React related files with the `.h` extension. Make sure `Parallelize Builds` is off for both schemes. In `Product` > `Scheme` > `Manage schemes` > Open the `Build` tab > Uncheck `Parallelize Builds`. Do this for both the `Playpost` and `PlaypostShareExtension`.
This will make sure React get's build first.

## iOS Deployment Target 10.0
The Deployment Target is locked at `10.0` because of the Share Extension. Any version higher than `10.0` makes the Share Extension not work in Safari in iOS. Pretty important.

## Share Extension iOS Target Properties
Make sure the Share Extension has the properties below. This makes sure the Share Extension is visible in; Safari, other browsers like Chrome Ã¡nd other apps that share URL's from within the App. So our Share Extension shows in those apps.
