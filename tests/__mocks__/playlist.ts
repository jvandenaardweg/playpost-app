Anonieme agenten suggereren in <em>De Telegraaf </em>dat deze aanhouding, die vorige maand plaatsvond, onder de pet is gehouden.</p><p>"Bij voorlichting over het werk van de politie en het OM gaat het om de balans tussen openheid en transparantie enerzijds en de belangen van een eerlijke procesgang en de privacy van de betrokkenen anderzijds", aldus de autoriteiten in een gezamenlijk persbericht.</p><p>"Het algemene beleid dat geldt voor elke vijftienjarige jongen in Nederland is gehanteerd. Er is dan ook helemaal geen sprake van dat een aanhouding \'onder de pet\' is gehouden", zo schrijven politie en justitie.</p><p>De politie is gestart met een integriteitsonderzoek naar wie informatie over de aanhouding heeft gelekt naar <em>De Telegraaf.</em></p><h2>Krant schreef over gewapende inbraak</h2><p><em>De Telegraaf </em>meldde woensdag groots in de krant dat de zoon van Halsema in juli een gewapende inbraak zou hebben gepleegd. Dit is door de burgemeester én de advocaat van de jongen, Peter Plasman, direct genuanceerd.</p><p>De tiener zou samen met een leeftijdsgenoot een verlaten woonboot hebben betreden. De deur van de woonboot zou open hebben gestaan. Daar hebben ze met een brandblusser gespoten.</p><p>Iemand heeft tijdens dit rumoer de politie gebeld. De zoon van Halsema rende weg en ontdeed zich hierbij ook van een nepwapen. De raadsman en de burgemeester beschrijven het voorval als puberaal gedrag, waar hij volgens zijn moeder "wel verantwoording voor moet afleggen".</p><h2>OM buigt zich nog over dossier</h2><p>De officier van justitie heeft vorige week het dossier over de vijftienjarige zoon van Halsema gekregen en moet zich dus nog buigen over de zaak, zo wordt gemeld aan NU.nl. De zaak is, voor deze in de publiciteit kwam, al overgedragen aan het OM in Haarlem om elke schijn van belangenverstrengeling te voorkomen.</p><p>Naar verwachting kan er pas in september iets iets over het incident gemeld worden. Dan is bijvoorbeeld pas duidelijk of er nader onderzoek moet plaatsvinden en of het überhaupt tot een zaak komt.</p></div></div></div></div>',

Er was geen sprake van een terroristische daad. Malek F. krijgt tbs met dwangverpleging opgelegd.</p><p>Volgens de rechter is de "persoon van de verdachte essentieel" bij de veroordeling. Uit verklaring van deskundigen is volgens de rechter duidelijk gebleken dat de man "ernstige paranoïde wanen" had tijdens zijn daad.</p><p>"Hoewel de man afschuwelijke strafbare feiten heeft gepleegd, is hij geen strafbare dader", verduidelijkte de rechtbank. "Hij wordt daarom ontslagen van alle rechtsvervolging."</p><p>De uit Syrië gevluchte F. stak vorig jaar op 5 mei op het Johanna Westerdijkplein in Den Haag willekeurig drie mensen neer. Zij raakten levensgevaarlijk gewond, maar overleefden alle drie. In verklaringen lieten de slachtoffers weten nog steeds te lijden.</p><p>F. had volgens de rechter niet het doel om mensen vrees aan te jagen en daarom is er geen sprake van een terroristisch oogmerk. "Ook al zijn door zijn daad mensen wel angstig geworden", aldus de rechter.</p><h2>Rechtbank: Man wilde duivelsaanbidders doden</h2><p>Wel was er sprake van voorbedachten rade en dus drievoudige poging tot moord. Het kan de man namelijk worden aangerekend dat hij al langer het plan had om mensen te doden en op 2 mei 2018 met dat doel een mes kocht.</p><p>De man verklaarde zelf dat hij op de dag van zijn daad van een vogel de opdracht kreeg om mensen neer te steken. Het ging volgens F. om duivelsaanbidders.</p><p>De rechtbank neemt deze verklaring over en ziet zich gesteund door de eerder genoemde getuigenissen van de deskundigen. "De man deed voor zijn daad zelfs aangifte van achtervolging door duivelsaanbidders."</p><p>De rechtbank erkende dat de man er extremistische en radicale ideeën op na hield, maar dat dit het gevolg was van zijn "paranoïde psychose".</p><h2>Advocaat F. waarschuwt cliënt voor kans op hoger beroep</h2><p>Job Knoester, een van de advocaten van F., laat in een reactie aan NU.nl weten het vonnis goed te zullen bestuderen, omdat er tbs is opgelegd en geen behandeling in een psychiatrisch ziekenhuis (zoals door de verdediging werd verzocht).</p><p>De veroordeling leidt volgens Knoester tot het intrekken van de verblijfsvergunning van de man en dat maakt verlof onmogelijk. F. reageerde zelf opgelucht op het vonnis, maar Knoester heeft hem proberen duidelijk te maken dat het Openbaar Ministerie (OM) nog in hoger beroep kan gaan.</p><h2>OM gaat wel van uit van terroristisch oogmerk</h2><p>Het OM eiste vijftien jaar en tbs in de overtuiging dat F. wel met een terroristisch oogmerk handelde. Hoewel hij deels ontoerekeningsvatbaar zou zijn geweest, was de man volgens justitie niet zo ziek als hij deed voorkomen.</p><p>Het OM komt desgevraagd later maandag nog met een reactie op het vonnis.</p></div></div></div></div>',

      html: '<div id="page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most of our workplaces are cluttered with distractions of many different kinds. These distractions are especially present in a popular open-office settings, which are<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/13/yes-open-office-plans-are-the-worst/"> proving to be more and more disruptive to the general productivity of teams</a>. From meetings to co-workers looking for a chat, it’s hard to get any meaningful work done in a modern office. Keeping focus is hard and productivity suffers. So, what can you do to actually get some work done every day?</p><p>There is no one single formula that makes you better at work. However, if you find out what works for you, you’ll be able to get more done in less time. Here are a few tips you can try to boost your focus.</p><h2>Just ignore people to keep the focus.</h2><p>There is a time for work and there is a time for socializing. To keep focused, you need to block out distraction free time. This means closing out of social media, turning a blind eye to the office drama unfolding in the corner, and putting any calls or requests from colleagues on hold. While everyone else may think that their problem is the biggest crisis in the world and demand your attention, there are very few things that can not wait an hour.</p><p>Personally, I like to work in blocks of 55 minutes and then dedicate 5 minutes to stretching, getting coffee, or checking out anything I’ve missed. For some people <a href="https://blog.weekdone.com/weekdone-helps-focus-work/">the longest they can focus effectively is 25 minutes.</a> Find the rhythm that works for you. If you have an office, closing the door helps. If you are working in an open office, a pair of good headphones is usually the best way to signal your unwillingness to talk.</p><h2>Manage your email and Slack.</h2><p>I once had a manager who never looked at his email before noon. His reasoning was that this way he could make sure that he gets meaningful work done before opening himself up to distractions. While many of us don’t have such luxury, it is still possible to regulate the way you get information online. You must set rules on when you read emails and who’s letters you open right away. Like face-to-face talks with co-workers, urgent emails are hardly ever urgent. Personally, unless it is an email of high-importance, I usually get to my emails the following morning. And, I only check my <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> conversions when I’m not in my 55-minute work sprint.</p><h2>Say “no” to meetings.</h2><p>While I don’t share the idea that meetings are the source of all evil, they often waste more resources than they are worth.</p><p>When I run a <a href="https://teammeetingchecklist.com/">meeting</a>, I make sure to have a very strict agenda and only the right people in the room. Due to that, I can usually keep my meetings under 30 minutes. However, many managers like to have a lot of them. So, you must be critical and learn to say “no”, if you feel you will not contribute anything to the meeting. If possible, it is also a good idea to schedule all your weekly meetings on one day. Then they won’t clutter up other days and allow you to have greater focus 4 days a week.</p><h2>Don’t go to the office.</h2><p>If you are lucky enough that your workplace allows some form of remote work, use it. Working from home allows you to focus your time better. You’ll save time on commuting and people will not come by your table to talk. I usually work at home a few days a week. This saves me about four hours of time from traveling and getting ready. Time, I can then spend on my family and hobbies. Work-life balance matters, so finding a way to do your work as well and as quickly as possible is important!</p><h2>Better to be drastic than useless.</h2><p>Yes, some of these may seem drastic, but it is the only way you can actually<a href="https://thenextweb.com/insights/2016/12/29/how-to-work-less-get-better-results/"> get work done</a>. Since I started working at Weekdone, I have tried all of these methods over the last 4 years. And while it might seem weird to start doing some of them, in time people will accept these behaviors. Especially, if they see how much more productive you’ll be.</p><p>This post is part of our contributor series.

Het onderzoek zou zich concentreren op het Canadese bedrijf Vermilion, dat onder meer in het Drentse dorp Diever meer dan drie keer de toegestane maximale productiehoeveelheid uit de grond haalde, blijkt uit gezamenlijk onderzoek van RTV Noord, RTV Oost, <a href="https://www.rtvdrenthe.nl/nieuws/149766/Strafrechtelijk-onderzoek-naar-versnelde-gaswinning-kleine-velden">RTV Drenthe</a> en Omrop Fryslân.</p><p>Het OM bevestigt dat er een strafrechtelijk onderzoek loopt, maar wil niet zeggen of het om Vermilion gaat. "We kunnen altijd pas melden dat we iets onderzoeken, indien verdachten daarvan ook op de hoogte zijn. Anders zouden ze in de krant moeten lezen dat ze als verdachte zijn aangemerkt en dat is niet netjes", zegt een woordvoerder.</p><h2>Aardbeving en bodemdaling</h2><p>Omwonenden zijn bang voor aardbevingen en bodemdaling. "De rechter in Den Haag heeft al gezegd dat er geen aanleiding is om te denken dat de risico\'s bij een klein gasveld kleiner zijn dan bij het Groningenveld", zegt Alie Eiting uit Diever.</p><p>Ook iets verderop, op de grens van Friesland, Groningen en Drenthe, vragen bewoners zich af wat de versnelde gaswinning in de buurt van hun huizen betekent. "Uit openbaar toegankelijke cijfers op internet is al gebleken dat de maatschappijen meer gas winnen dan in de vergunning is toegestaan", zegt Jeanette van der Velde van de stichting Gas Drenthe, Overijssel, Friesland (GasDrOvF). "Voor de duidelijkheid, die openbaar toegankelijke cijfers zijn afkomstig van de gasconcerns zelf."</p><h2>Wiebes voert productie op</h2><p>Gasbedrijven zijn bij alle velden die ze exploiteren verplicht om een winningsplan op te stellen. Als de minister instemt formuleert hij ook de voorwaarden. Die voorwaarden, zoals een maximale productiehoeveelheid, worden opgenomen in de omgevingsvergunning.</p><p>Omdat de gaswinning in het Groningenveld versneld wordt teruggebracht, heeft minister Wiebes afgelopen jaar meerdere vergunningen afgegeven voor kleinere velden in het noorden van het land. Hij voert daar de productie op. <a href="https://www.rtvdrenthe.nl/nieuws/149738/Tweede-Kamerleden-voelen-minister-Wiebes-aan-de-tand-over-opvoering-gaswinnning">Gisteren</a> zeiden de Tweede Kamerleden Henk Nijboer (PvdA) en Sandra Beckerman (SP) dat ze minister Wiebes daarover aan de tand gaan voelen.</p><h2>Lekkages</h2><p>Het OM doet niet alleen onderzoek naar de productie uit kleinere velden. Er loopt ook een onderzoek naar de NAM wegens verontreiniging in Collendoorn (Hardenberg) en Farmsum (Groningen). In Collendoorn was in januari dit jaar een lekkage. Ook in Farmsum zijn chemische stoffen in de bodem gelekt.</p></div></div></div></div>',

The company thanks the “great community” that existed for these games, but says:</p><blockquote><p>However, the time has come for us, along with our hardware and software partners, to invest our resources towards more recent technologies so that we can continue to deliver great new experiences. Current players may enjoy the games until the dates above, when game services will cease, and the games listed will no longer be playable.</p></blockquote><p>I’m sure this is most likely to effect those running Windows 7, which is still a fairly popular OS. Windows 10 only edged it out in market share earlier this year.

Windows XP, meanwhile, holds just over 3 percent. I couldn’t find any data on how many people still use Windows ME, but I’m going to guess it’s fewer than that.</p><p>It’s kind of sad to see such a staple of the gaming world — a somewhat understated, casual staple, but a staple nonetheless — get shut down. For many, this was the original casual gaming experience, the non-threatening addictive game pre-<em>Candy Crush</em>. But it’s understandable — all things come to an end, and a 19-year run is nothing to sneeze at.</p><p>That’s not to say we’ll never see checkers or backgammon on Windows again.

De Nederlandse overheid helpt multinationals grootschalig belasting te ontwijken, stelt Oxfam Novib dinsdag in een nieuw <a href="https://www.oxfamnovib.nl/Files/rapporten/2019/20190528%20Rapport%20belastinglek%20Nederland.pdf">rapport</a>.</p><p>Het gaat om een belastingconstructie die multinationals kunnen gebruiken om in Nederland fictieve kosten af te trekken. Zo hoeft over een deel van de winst geen belasting te worden geheven. Deze specifieke constructie heet een \'infokapstructuur\'.</p><p>"Omdat er nu maatregelen zijn aangekondigd tegen andere belastingtrucs, is het zeer aannemelijk dat meer multinationals gebruik gaan maken van een infokapstructuur", stelt Oxfam Novib.</p><p>De afgelopen jaren zouden bedrijven als brouwerij SABMiller, van onder meer Grolsch en Peroni, en modemerk G-Star de structuur al hebben gebruikt, waardoor "arme en rijke landen al honderden miljoenen euro\'s zijn misgelopen".</p><h2>Belastingparadijzen: Nederland op vierde plaats</h2><p>Nederland belandt volgens Oxfam mede hierdoor op vierde plek van de nieuwe <a href="https://www.taxjustice.net/2019/05/28/new-ranking-reveals-corporate-tax-havens-behind-breakdown-of-global-corporate-tax-system-toll-of-uks-tax-war-exposed/">ranglijst</a> met 64 belastingparadijzen wereldwijd, die onderzoeksnetwerk Tax Justice Network ook op dinsdag publiceert. Alleen de Britse Maagdeneilanden, Bermuda en de Kaaimaneilanden staan hoger.</p><p>"Om van het imago van belastingparadijs af te komen, moet Nederland op een overtuigende manier alle belastinglekken dichten", zegt Francis Weyzig, belastingexpert bij Oxfam Novib. Ook zou er meer publieke transparantie over belastingsafspraken met bedrijven moeten komen.</p><p>"Bovendien zouden grote multinationals moeten worden verplicht om voor elk land afzonderlijk gegevens te publiceren over de omvang van hun activiteiten, hun winst of verlies, en de bijbehorende belasting", aldus Weyzig.</p><p>Ontwikkelingslanden lopen volgens het onderzoek jaarlijks zo\'n 100 miljard dollar (ruim 89 miljard euro) aan belastinginkomsten mis door internationale belastingontwijking van bedrijven.</p></div></div></div></div>',

Zonder een spoor verdween ze op weg naar muziekles in Rome. Vanochtend werden er twee eeuwenoude graven geopend in de zoektocht naar haar.</p><p>Familie van Orlandi kreeg in maart een brief met een tip binnen: een foto van een engelenbeeld met de opdracht \'zoek waar de engel naar wijst\'. Het bleek te gaan om een standbeeld op de Teutoonse Begraafplaats in het Vaticaan, waar vroeger Duitsers begraven werden.</p><p>De engel wees naar twee graven, dat van prinses Sophie van Hohenlohe uit de achttiende eeuw, en het graf van prinses Charlotta Frederika van Mecklenburg, die in 1840 overleed. Beide tombes werden vandaag geopend voor onderzoek.</p><p><em>Zo ging dat in zijn werk:</em></p></div></div><div><div><p>Verwacht werd dat het onderzoek enkele weken zou duren, maar het Vaticaan kon aan het begin van de middag al duidelijkheid geven: de graven waren beide leeg. Botten van de prinsessen waren al vergaan, ook het meisje werd niet aangetroffen.</p><p>Emanuela\'s broer hoopte de zoektocht eindelijk af te sluiten, maar zet zijn werk nu door. "Het is mijn plicht haar te blijven zoeken totdat ik haar lichaam vind", legde hij vooraf uit. "Ook als er niks gevonden wordt, is dit niet het einde van het verhaal."</p><h2>Openheid van Vaticaan</h2><p>De begraafplaats ligt op een steenworp afstand van de woning waar Emanuela\'s moeder nog altijd woont. Omdat haar vader werkte bij de Vaticaanbank, woonde het gezin in de katholieke stadstaat.</p><p>Volgens de broer van Emanuela, die nog altijd zoekt naar zijn zus, is het voor het eerst dat het Vaticaan actief meewerkt aan het onderzoek. "Ze hebben nooit samengewerkt met onderzoekers of met ons", zei hij tegen CNN. "Ze hebben altijd ontkend dat er een band is met het Vaticaan."</p><p>Correspondent Mustafa Marghadi denkt dat het Vaticaan onder paus Franciscus een nieuwe benadering probeert. "Het Vaticaan wil zich transparant tonen in de hoop duidelijk te maken dat het zelf geen rol speelt in het toedekken van een sinister Vaticaancomplot."</p><p>"In de verdwijningszaak is vaak betrokkenheid van het Vaticaan gesuggereerd. Van seksfeesten in het Vaticaan die hiertoe geleid zouden hebben tot maffia-afpersing van de Vaticaanbank, of zelfs een kidnapping om de Turkse aanslagpleger op paus Johannes Paulus II vrij te krijgen."</p></div></div></div></div>',

Het lichaam van Van Seggeren werd in juli 2017 gevonden in een weiland in de Friese plaats De Westereen.</p><p>De rechtbank acht bewezen dat Jessica B. (35) haar man naar het weiland heeft gelokt nadat hij bij een festival was geweest. Daar is hij afgeleid en vermoord.</p><p>Het wapen waarmee Van Seggeren werd gedood, is nooit gevonden. De rechtbank baseert zich onder meer op DNA-sporen, getuigen en inconsistente verklaringen van de weduwe. Telefoondata wijzen uit dat het stel in elkaars buurt was rond het moment van overlijden.</p><p>Van Seggeren (foto) is om het leven gekomen als gevolg van hersenfunctiestoornissen en het daarop uitvallen van organen. Hij had zwaar hoofdletsel en meerdere grote verwondingen.</p><p>Zijn familie en anderen wezen al snel naar B. als dader. Het stel zou relatieproblemen hebben.</p><h2>Justitie denkt dat B. hulp heeft gekregen</h2><p>Justitie denkt dat B. niet alleen gehandeld heeft. Onder anderen haar moeder is eerder gehoord als verdachte. Bij het uitspreken van de strafeis liet de officier van justitie weten dat in een later stadium wordt besloten over de vervolging van deze vrouw.</p><p>Volgens de rechter zijn er aanwijzingen dat B. niet alleen heeft gehandeld, maar ontbreken concrete aanwijzingen.</p><p>B. heeft altijd volgehouden dat het juist Van Seggeren was die haar vroeg hem te ontmoeten in het weiland. Ze zei tijdens een eerdere zitting in de zaak dat ze hem die bewuste avond niet had aangetroffen en naar huis is gegaan. Haar telefoon zou zijn uitgevallen, waardoor ze haar man niet kon bellen.</p></div></div></div></div>',

De huizenprijzen stijgen minder hard en het woningaanbod is toegenomen, schrijft de Nederlandse Vereniging van Makelaars (NVM) donderdag bij de publicatie van de woningmarktcijfers over het tweede kwartaal.</p><p>Het aantal verkochte woningen is in het tweede kwartaal iets toegenomen ten opzichte van een jaar eerder. Dat is voor het eerst in twee jaar.</p><p>In totaal wisselden een krappe 39.200 woningen van eigenaar bij NVM-makelaars, goed voor een stijging van 1,8 procent in vergelijking met een jaar eerder. Het is voor het eerst in twee jaar dat het aantal verkochte woningen stijgt. De gemiddelde verkoopprijs is nu 308.000 euro, 7,4 procent hoger dan vorig jaar.</p><p>De NVM ziet vooral een stijging in de prijsklasse tussen 300.000 en 750.000 euro. In deze klasse zijn 20 procent meer woningen verkocht dan in hetzelfde kwartaal een jaar eerder.</p><p>In Amsterdam is de gemiddelde verkoopprijs gedaald met 4 procent. Dat komt volgens de NVM niet doordat de woningen in waarde zijn gedaald, maar doordat er vooral woningen buiten de ring zijn verkocht, waar de prijzen een stuk lager liggen.</p><h2>Juist minder nieuwbouw verkocht</h2><p>In tegenstelling tot het aantal verkochte bestaande woningen is het aantal nieuwbouwwoningen dat is verkocht juist gedaald, met 13 procent. NVM-voorzitter Ger Jaarsma wijt de daling aan de hoge prijzen.</p><p>De prijs voor een gemiddelde nieuwbouwwoning steeg naar 387.000 euro; een toename van 17 procent: "De gemiddelde nieuwbouwwoning is al twee kwartalen op rij 80.000 euro duurder dan een gemiddelde bestaande woning en dat is echt een probleem", aldus Jaarsma.</p><p>Die prijzen zijn volgens hem op hun beurt weer het gevolg van hoge personeels-, bouw- en grondkosten. Ook beleidsmaatregelen zoals gasloos bouwen hebben invloed. "Het stapelen van overheidsbeleid werkt prijsopdrijvend en daarmee averechts voor de woningmarkt."</p></div></div></div></div>',

Dat blijkt uit een analyse van wetenschappers van Crowther Lab, dat onderdeel uitmaakt van de Zwitserse universiteit ETH Zürich.</p><p>De onderzoekers melden dat 77 procent van de steden in de wereld tegen 2050 te maken krijgt met een "opvallende verandering" in klimaatomstandigheden.</p><p>Het gaat in sommige gevallen zelfs om omstandigheden die momenteel niet worden ervaren in bestaande grote steden, stellen ze in een verklaring.</p><p>In Europa wordt het in zowel de zomer als winter warmer, waarschuwen de wetenschappers. Ze willen het voor mensen tastbaarder maken wat klimaatverandering voor hun eigen leefomgeving betekent. Er is onder meer een interactieve kaart gemaakt, waarop te zien is hoe het klimaat in steden naar verwachting zal veranderen.</p><h2>\'Temperatuur in Amsterdam meer dan 3 graden hoger\'</h2><p>"Het klimaat in Londen zal in 2050 vergelijkbaar zijn met het klimaat nu in Barcelona, Madrid met Marrakesh, Moskou met Sofia", sommen ze op. Uit de kaart blijkt dat de maximale temperatuur tijdens de warmste maand in Amsterdam in 2050 waarschijnlijk 3,4 graden hoger ligt dan nu het geval is.</p><p>Wetenschapper Tom Crowther zegt dat precies meten wat de gevolgen van klimaatverandering zijn niet langer de grootste uitdaging in klimaatwetenschap is: het gaat er volgens hem nu vooral om mensen zo ver te krijgen dat ze de concrete gevolgen ervan visualiseren zodat ze in actie komen.</p><h2>\'Mensen te weinig doordrongen van acute klimaatprobleem\'</h2><p>"De geschiedenis heeft herhaaldelijk uitgewezen dat alleen data en feiten onvoldoende zijn om mensen van gedachten te doen veranderen of ze ertoe aan te zetten in actie te komen", zegt hoofdonderzoeker Jean-François Bastin. Uit berichten over klimaatverandering zou momenteel onvoldoende naar voren komen hoe acuut het probleem is.</p><p>"Het is bijvoorbeeld moeilijk om te visualiseren hoe een temperatuurstijging van 2 graden, of veranderingen in de gemiddelde temperatuur in 2100, het dagelijks leven kunnen beïnvloeden."</p></div></div></div></div>',

      html: '<div id="page-1" class="page"><p>"Our main challenge then became this: how do you find product-market fit when you are not yet launched?"</p><div><p>About two years ago, the Product Hunt community <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/392">got a first look</a> at Superhuman, an app that promised to be the “fastest email experience in the world.” 60,000 people subscribed to get access.</p><p>Today, Superhuman remains invitation-only and its larger waiting list is 180,000 people long. How? There’s evidently a demand for a faster and more sophisticated email client than the 15-year-old Gmail.</p><p>So what happens when you <em>do</em> get that coveted Superhuman invitation (and pay the $30/month price tag for access)?</p><p>Superhuman plugs into your existing email account, but only works with Gmail and Google G Suite addresses right now.</p><p>Some of the app’s features: Superhuman lets users undo sending an email, track email opens and send follow-up reminders. It’s more ~unique~ features include keyboard shortcuts for everything, “instant intro” for moving introductory email senders to bcc and a scheduling tool that automatically pulls up your calendar when you’re typing out a day of the week.</p><p>Today, Superhuman announced a $33M investment by Andreessen Horowitz, bringing the company’s total funding raised to $51M. The company is valued at roughly $260M.</p><p>We spoke with Superhuman founder, Rahul Vohra — who previously founded Rapportive (another email startup that sold to LinkedIn in 2012) — about the news, as well as the lessons he’s learning building a product that hasn’t actually launched yet.</p><p><strong>On raising capital (in stealth):</strong> If you are raising money, raise significantly more than you think you\'ll need. Ideally, raise one whole round ahead of your current level of traction. This means that you raise your pre-seed when you would normally have nothing, that you raise your seed when you would normally have your pre-seed, that you raise your Series A when you would normally have your seed, and so on. This will give you the time it takes — and it does take time — to build a truly remarkable product.</p><p><strong>On the non-traditional launch (or lack thereof):</strong> The Product Hunt community absolutely adores productivity tools. We could see this by looking at the most upvoted submissions — almost all of them are for productivity. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/ship">Ship</a> was perfect for us — it is a very fast way to grow an early and enthusiastic audience without having to prepare the buzz and materials for a traditional Product Hunt launch.</p><p><strong>On finding product-market fit:</strong> Fortunately, we were able to raise a lot of money. Our main challenge then became this: how do you find product-market fit when you are not yet launched? To solve this, I created our now infamous <a href="https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/">Product-Market Fit Engine</a>. It gives you a way to define product-market fit, a metric to measure product-market fit, and a methodology to systematically increase product-market fit. It can even generate your roadmap for you!</p><p><strong>On why Superhuman works:</strong> You\'ll see that folks love Superhuman for three main reasons: they get through their inbox twice as fast as before, they respond to important emails faster, and many see Inbox Zero for the first time in years. The funding will be used to double down on all three. Superhuman is already the fastest email experience in the world, but we are going to make it even faster.</p></div></div>',

Last week, though, Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the four justices who disagreed with Chief Justice John Roberts’s opinion in <em>Rucho v. Common Cause </em>purporting to withdraw the Court once and for all from passing judgment on the constitutionality of partisan gerrymanders, ended thus:</p><blockquote><p>Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections. With respect but deep sadness, I dissent.</p></blockquote><p>Kagan’s occasion for sorrow is deep not only because the chief justice left a fundamental flaw in our constitutional democracy without hope of a judicial remedy, but because of the defective reasoning by which he came to that conclusion.</p><p>Roberts is clear and emphatic that extreme partisan gerrymanders are wrongs—wrongs of constitutional dimensions. In North Carolina, for example, voters split more or less down the middle, yet the congressional delegation consists of 10 Republicans and just three Democrats. The disfavored voters were treated unequally, their unequal treatment was due to their political commitments, and so they were given an unequal voice in the legislature. This violated not only the Fourteenth Amendment’s norms of equality, but the norms of the First Amendment, as well. Indeed, it was contrary to the most basic political premise of our government: that the people choose their representatives, not the other way around.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Not only the chief but other justices as well have said as much in past decisions, but hesitated to offer a remedy. All this the chief recounts in his opinion. Yet he concludes—and now, after 40 years of temporizing, hopes to conclude definitively—that these are wrongs that are beyond judicial reparation. If there are to be remedies, they must lie elsewhere: in the states or in Congress.</p><p>Why? Roberts offers an argument with three simple steps. First, he claims that some departure from equality of voice—the notion that every voter should have an equal say—is not only inevitable, but constitutionally, and as a matter of political morality, quite justifiable. Next, he admits that the case may be an extreme deprivation of a constitutional right, an extreme gerrymander—acknowledged, deliberately engineered and frankly avowed, and arranged so as to persist though many election cycles. But, he concludes, it is not possible to draw a precise line that separates an extreme gerrymander such as this one from a less extreme one, or between a less extreme gerrymander and one that is perfectly proper. If splitting North Carolina’s seats 10 to three is extreme, perhaps a nine-to-four split is, as well. But what of eight to five, or seven to six?</p><p>The courts can act, the remedy is a judicial remedy, Roberts concludes, only if the line of demarcation is “precise,” to use the word he invokes six times. If one cannot say where the precise borderline of the extreme lies, everything must be allowed. But applying that argument to other questions illustrates its absurdity. <em>If one cannot say how many hairs a man may have to still count as bald, there are no bald men. If one cannot draw the exact line between venal and mortal sin, then there is no mortal sin.</em></p><p>This is not a logical principle, and it is certainly not a juridical one. The law is replete with conclusions that depend on judgments that something is extreme, unusual, or outrageous, without offering the precise boundaries of that judgment. Take two examples from the chief justice’s own corpus. In his dissent in the 2012 case of <em>Armour v. Indianapolis</em>, he wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Our precedents do not ask for much from government in this area [of property taxation]—only “rough equality in tax treatment” … We give great leeway to taxing authorities in this area, for good and sufficient reasons. But every generation or so a case comes along when this Court needs to say enough is enough, if the Equal Protection Clause is to retain any force in this context.”</p></blockquote><p>And, similarly, in the 2007 case of <em>Federal Election Commission v. </em><em>Wisconsin Right To Life</em>, he argued:</p><blockquote><p>[Our prior precedents] … applied [the] … interest in combatting corruption or the appearance of corruption … to ads that were the “functional equivalent” of express advocacy. But to justify regulation of WRTL’s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy. Enough is enough. Issue ads like WRTL’s are by no means equivalent to contributions, and the quid-pro-quo corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.</p></blockquote><p>Enough is enough, indeed.</p></div></div><div><div><p>But, as Kagan argues in her dissent, this case should be easier than many in which gathering outrage tips over into judicial condemnation. This issue has firmer bones than that.</p><p>Roberts’s faulty reasoning is built on the premise that pure equality of voice cannot and need not be demanded. And in some ways, he is correct. Proportional representation may be a possible end of apportioning representatives but it is not a necessary one, and the Court has no business making it one in the name of the Constitution. An apportioning legislature may take into account many legitimate ideals in drawing district lines: political or other historic boundaries, economic commonalities, even the desire not to pit incumbents against one another.</p><p>Drawing new lines, in other words, allows many legitimate political judgments—but disadvantaging racial minorities is not one of them, and neither should be freezing one party in and the other party out, no matter what their voting strength. Sometimes politicians are brazen enough to declare that one or the other of these forbidden ends is what they are striving to pursue, but usually they are not. They just do it.</p><p>In such a case, you can still smoke out the legitimate from the illegitimate. As the mathematician and genome scientist Eric Lander argued in an amicus brief on this issue, there are literally thousands of ways of drawing equipopulous legislative districts for any given state, arrived at either randomly or pursuant to some congeries of legitimate criteria. If only legitimate criteria are used, then political preferences are likely to be more or less evenly distributed—a normal distribution or bell curve. The farther out on the curve you get, the more likely something fishy is going on. It could be chance, or it could be the influence of some unsuspected factor, but if you are way out on the tail—as in North Carolina—you are staring at extreme partisanship, and you should be able to call it like it is and condemn it. Enough is enough.</p><p>Ah, but how small, how far out on the tail? This is not a question unique to gerrymandering; in other fields, we have settled upon practical answers and used them in practical ways: In medicine, in approving new drugs, in statistics generally, a 95 percent confidence level is usually thought to be quite enough to show causation. One hundred percent is absolute certainty and 50 is mere random chance, no causation at all. But why not set the standard at something closer to 100 percent? Aristotle explained in the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>:</p><blockquote><p>It is the mark of an educated mind to expect only that amount of exactness which the nature of the particular subject admits. It is equally unreasonable to accept merely probable conclusions from a mathematician and to demand strict demonstration from an orator.</p></blockquote><p>In a myriad of less consequential decisions, Roberts has shown himself to be an eminently reasonable person, an “educated mind.” But in <em>Rucho </em>he leads the sticklers to produce a hyper-partisan political result.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Nor should anyone find consolation in the chief’s profession of judicial modesty and abstinence, his insistence that this is just a job for other organs of government—legislatures, the states. How can you rely on gerrymandered legislatures to remedy gerrymandering? Remember, it is Roberts who wrote the devastating decision in <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>, declaring unconstitutional Section 4 of the recently reenacted Voting Rights Act, thereby unleashing an immediate, utterly predictable, and devastating wave of partisan voting-rights suppression all over the South. And it was Roberts who wrote for four dissenters who found that Arizona’s independent redistricting commission was unconstitutional based on a hyper-literal reading of the Constitution’s elections clause. But for the lack of a single vote (which today he probably has), he would have closed off one of the few ways to break the vicious circle of gerrymandering.</p><p><em>Rucho </em>was indeed an occasion of deep sorrow—for the Court and its chief, for the rational development of doctrine, but most of all for American democracy.

Even with thousands of lines of code, it’s not so hard to manage.</p><p>It’s not like we would repeat functionality with a slightly different object or anything.</p><p>We aren’t going to create duplicate functionality with multiple objects.</p><p>So why do over-experience software engineers care so much?</p><p>In the end, we would write code ten times faster and be able to provide impact much more efficiently if we didn’t need to spend time thinking through a design document.</p></div><hr><div><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/19/1*SsWEz-V9tEpXOYk8njMSwA.png?q=20"></p><p><img></p></div></div></figure><p>At a certain point, I think some engineers no longer want to think about other people’s code.</p><p>So when you create a module that utilizes everything you learned at school all in one amalgamation of object-oriented memoization, they like to claim that the code is <em>over-engineered</em>.</p><p>Personally, we just think that they don’t want to think through the brilliance of someone else’s masterpiece.</p><p>How hard would it be to take the time to understand the how object A inherits from object B, which calls function C, which then calls function D and sometimes options F or G that pulls in information from config file E, which uses function F to parse data from database G that then stores logs in Hadoop, CouchDB, and S3.</p><p>They start to complain and say that the code is too elegant and or over-engineered. Their laziness keeps well-designed code that is really easy to maintain out of production. Instead, they attempt to push younger engineers to write code that is too simple.</p><p>Sure, it might seem like it’s easy to look at and understand. But as engineers, we aren’t focused on simplification. We take complicated problems and create complicated solutions.</p><p>The frameworks I know now are the only frameworks I will need to know from now until I die.</p><p>Yet, over-experienced engineers seem to spend a lot of time learning new frameworks and languages or at the very least, reading up on new design principles.</p><p>It all seems like a waste of time. As an engineer, you should be smart enough to know everything you need to know after you finish college. Anything after the fact is clearly not important. Some of them even still <a href="/better-programming/the-software-engineering-study-guide-bac25b8b61eb">practice leet code problems and study</a>, as if they might have an interview coming up. It’s not like software engineers have to worry about being let go.</p><p>Doesn’t everyone still program in the language they learned in college?</p></div><hr><div><p>Over-experienced software engineers hold society back.</p><p>With their constant need for code-refactoring, design documents and learning they keep major software advancements from moving forward. We’re pretty sure we would already have flying cars and robots that are smarter than us right now if it wasn’t for over-experienced engineers. Instead, we’re stuck with 280-character Tweets and Amazon ads that keep trying to sell me the same toilet seat cover I bought last week.</p></div></div></div>',

      html: '<div id="page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you don’t think it could get much worse for Neil Woodford, it does. And now it seems that the scandal around Britain’s most famous fund manager could pave the way for a new type of investment fund. </p><p>While a new fund had technically been in the pipeline for a while, the timing of the announcement – coming shortly after the Woodford fund suspension – is poignant.</p><p>Last week, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney waded into the debate about Woodford-style funds, saying that they are “built on a lie” – referring of course to the paradox of funds that hold hard-to-sell illiquid assets but which also claim to allow investors to take their money out whenever they like. </p><p>As we have seen with Woodford’s equity income fund, which is currently suspended until at least 29 July, it’s really not that simple. In fact, if lots of people flock to cash-in all at once, the reality is that your money could end up being locked in for months. </p><p>While Woodford’s certainly isn’t first fund to ever suspend (think back to the Brexit vote when several property funds suspended for months), the former star manager has really highlighted the conflict between the structure of open-ended funds and the underlying assets. </p><p>Carney warned that half of investment funds have this structural mismatch. “Under stress, they may need to fire-sell assets, magnifying market adjustments and triggering further redemptions – a vicious feedback loop that can ultimately disrupt market functioning.”</p><p>Over recent weeks, the rallying call for regulators to take action to prevent another Woodford debacle has grown louder, though the launch of a whole new investment fund was perhaps not what most people had in mind. </p><p>Last week, the Investment Association published a report containing details of a new so-called “long-term asset fund”. A more detailed blueprint will be published later this year, but it’s thought that the fund would only allow investors to trade on a monthly or quarterly basis, rather than daily. </p><p>The industry seems less than enthusiastic about the idea, with some arguing that this tries to turn open-ended funds into something that they are not. </p><p>It also seems to ignore the fact that we already have a vehicle perfectly suited to holding long-term, illiquid assets in the form of investment trusts. Investment trusts do not have this inherent liquidity mismatch because they do not offer redemption. Instead, investors buy and sell their shares on the stock market, which means that trading has no impact on the underlying portfolio. </p><p>Ian Sayers, chief executive of the Association of Investment Companies (AIC), says that the proposals do not address the fundamental issues raised by the recent suspension of the Woodford fund. “We appear to be heading towards a world with less frequent redemption opportunities, more frequent suspensions, and the likelihood that open-ended managers will hold ever greater amounts of cash, reducing investment returns,” he says.</p><p>The AIC suggests that asset managers which offer open-ended funds holding illiquid assets should publish reasons why the structure chosen is in the best interest of consumers.</p><p>As Sayers adds: “There are many commercial reasons why asset managers favour open-ended funds over closed-ended funds, even when it is clear that the closed-ended structure is better suited to illiquid assets. We believe that the time has come to put consumers’ interests first.”</p><p>It’s strange that attention has focused on creating something new, rather than looking at how we can better utilise what is already available. And in fact, launching a new type of fund could create more problems than it solves.</p><p>For one, there are questions around how popular this long-term fund would actually be, as it fails to address the fact that investors want easy access to their own cash.</p><p>Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, warns that he would be very cautious about recommending the fund, because many clients expect to be able to sell their investments and get their money back quickly. “Execution-only platforms are designed around this convenience, and for many of those investors, having some funds with monthly dealing makes the investment experience more complex.”</p><p>The worry is that investors could get confused by all the various rules that apply to different types of fund, and only really be reminded when they want to cash-in.</p><p>Meanwhile, monthly dealing doesn’t necessarily remove the issue of liquidity, because in extreme circumstances, the fund manager could still be forced to sell. And of course, a fund doesn’t have to hold a significant amount of illiquid assets to run into trouble.</p><p>It’s understandable that regulators want to be seen to be taking action, but perhaps the question is not whether we need more rules, but whether existing regulation is being properly enforced. Note that the FCA started investigating Woodford over his breach of the unquoted cap as early as February 2018.</p><p>Shaun Port, chief investment officer at Nutmeg, does not think that a new fund is the answer: “The Woodford crisis was avoidable through more appropriate liquidity and risk analysis by the fund manager, and through robust due diligence by those promoting the fund,” he says.</p><p>“It is not the fund structure that is at fault here, rather the way that the portfolio was structured and managed.” </p><p>But there is another way that creating a new fund misses the point. </p><p>Woodford has damaged investors’ trust in the industry, so for many people, the prospect of having your savings locked away in a long-term fund is unlikely to sound very appealing. </p><p>Indeed, Holly Mackay, founder of Boring Money, thinks that this is the bigger issue that needs resolving. </p><p>“Fund managers are very good at thinking that the answer to everything can be found by an engineer or an actuary, but a new product structure should be a secondary consideration,” she says. “The bigger problem is to sort out people’s mistrust of the industry. This means being clearer about what a fund is trying to do, and precisely how much it costs.”</p><p>At the moment, the launch of a long-term fund seems like an unhelpful knee-jerk reaction. For the investment industry and its regulator, it’s really time to reassess their priorities.</p></div></div>',

      html: '<div id="page-1" class="page"><div><p>"I don\'t care if it\'s a man or woman, I just want someone who\'s qualified for the job," one entrepreneur said.</p><p>It\'s time to stop thinking about your job candidates\' qualifications as they are reported on paper. <a href="https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/its-an-employees-market-now-this-is-actually-good-news-for-small-business-owners.html">Entrepreneurs in search of new hires</a> also need to consider their existing team\'s collective intelligence to create a diverse balance of creativity, empathy, logic, experience, and skill.</p><p>Studies dating back into the 90s reveal that a diverse workforce is more productive, creative, and profitable. Today, I\'m specifically addressing gender diversity. It\'s clear that <a href="https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/no-women-on-your-team-you-may-be-missing-some-of-best-talent-according-to-walmartcom-ceo.html">having both men and women on your team</a> will take your company further and faster. A hiring decision that includes consideration of gender diversity is simply a smarter decision for entrepreneurs. </p><p>This is not strictly about equality; mixed gender groups simply make better decisions. The teams that take social sensitivity, as well as other substantive issues, into consideration come up with ideas and solutions that promise the most beneficial outcome.</p><p><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236543/business-benefits-gender-diversity.aspx">This Gallup study</a> of more than 800 business units in retail and hospitality found that gender-diverse companies have better financial outcomes than those dominated by one gender. The study found that retail units that are diverse and engaged have a 46% higher increase in comparable revenue. Similarly, diverse and engaged units in the hospitality company have a 58% higher net profit than single-gender and less-engaged units, the study says.</p><p>Whether your company is comprised of mostly (or exclusively) men or women can have a significant impact on its future. Finding the sweet spot in gender balance holds greater promise of profitability, innovative expression, and growth. The fact is, <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/does-diversity-actually-increase-creativity">diverse teams can develop more innovative ideas</a>. When people from different contexts work together, their unique perspectives often lead to better results.</p><h2>How to balance your culture successfully.</h2><p>The entrepreneur, a woman, to whom I referred in the first paragraph of this article has a company of eight employees: seven men and one woman, who is in a clerical role. In a situation like this, hiring a woman for another clerical position will not achieve the balance that entrepreneurs should look for. Overall diversity is important, but it must be throughout the company, including higher-level positions, to offer a significant impact.</p><p>As you evaluate the position you are filling be sure to consider how high levels of emotional intelligence could benefit your company. Many of the qualities responsible for creating the winning balance are found in women. This includes, but is not limited to, social sensitivity, <a href="https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/tim-ferriss-jeff-bezos-other-entrepreneurial-icons-swear-by-this-secret-weapon-you-have-it-too.html">intuition</a>, an ability to read non-verbal cues, and an understanding of what the female consumer or customer is most attracted to. Men are exceptionally good at focusing, getting rid of extraneous data, taking greater risks, and pushing full steam ahead.</p><p>This is not to say that both sexes cannot bring these qualities to the table. However, the differences between men and women are strongly shaped by socialization and the way we are raised. Men and women have vastly different life experiences to draw upon. Too few, or too many, members of either sex on your team will not give <a href="https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/give-your-customer-what-they-want-not-just-what-they-need-its-a-game-changer.html">your customers</a> or your team a complete experience. In my opinion, this is especially true in marketing. I marvel at how many ads completely lack feminine appeal; an important quality considering the purchasing power of the female demographic.</p><h2>Develop a culture of inclusion.</h2><p>According to <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/242138/requirements-diverse-inclusive-culture.aspx">this Gallup study</a>, employees in inclusive environments feel appreciated for their unique characteristics and are therefore comfortable sharing their ideas and other aspects of their true and authentic selves.</p><p>To create a thriving culture, give equal consideration to everyone\'s opinions and input, even if at first you are tempted to reject them. Oftentimes, an entrepreneur\'s judgment comes from <a href="https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/7-devastating-startup-mistakes-that-you-dont-have-to-make.html">preconceptions of their own</a>, this is a great opportunity to expand your mind.</p><h2>Bonus: Overall diversity will attract more applicants.</h2><p>In a survey of 1,000 respondents, Glassdoor found that 67% of job seekers look at workforce diversity when evaluating an offer. In today\'s world, a culture of gender diversity and inclusion makes your company more appealing to both sexes. The survey found that 72 percent of women and 62 percent of men consider workforce diversity important.</p><p>The next time you review the qualifications you\'ve included in your job descriptions include these soft skills. It may take a bit longer to find your ideal candidate, but if you don\'t, it may take much longer to achieve your next level of success.</p></div><p>The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.</p></div>',

I was doing what I thought were the right things. I was pumping out content. I was pushing my business onto anyone who was listening. I was taking on work from anyone who offered it.</p><p>But I wasn’t getting anywhere.</p><p>Turns out, I hadn’t done any of the necessary groundwork. I hadn’t built the foundation of my business properly. What reputation does my business have? What relationships am I developing? What I am doing this for? Am I taking the right opportunities?</p><p>I was failing because I was focused purely on the destination, and not on building the best possible path to it.</p><p>So what can you do to help you achieve the success you want so bad?</p><p><strong>You can start by taking the time to get crystal clear on your principles.</strong></p><p>You need to introduce principles that make you a better person and improve your own work. Principles that when applied, increase the chances of ‘making it’. Principles that will help to build a brilliant reputation for your business, find the right clients, and increase your work satisfaction.</p><p>Since growing my business, four principles have served me well and if implemented can do the same for you.</p></div><hr><div><p>Humility is a vital part of success. Being able to appreciate what you have, and what you don’t have, helps keep your feet firmly planted on the ground, no matter what heady heights you are reaching.</p><p>Humility is also being grateful for the opportunities and the jobs you get, the people you meet, and the chances that come your way.</p><p>Humility and gratitude will carry you very far in your journey to success. As Gary Vaynerchuck says, “One is greater than zero.”</p><p>You should never expect anything, but you should expect to earn everything.</p><p>These are the<em> </em>‘humble beginnings’<em> </em>for a reason, and you should take nothing for granted.</p><h2>How can you be more humble?</h2><ul><li><strong>Accept that you don’t know everything</strong>. Once you come to terms with this, you can start to ask the right questions. You can start listening to others. And this will help you learn, and improve.</li><li><strong>Accept that you have weaknesses.</strong> Acknowledging these weak points, and being willing to listen to other’s advice, or asking for their feedback, can turn them into strengths.</li><li><strong>Appreciate that others are putting their neck out for you. </strong>If you are new to the game, and people are taking chances on you, you should be eternally grateful to them. Catching your big break is so hard, so thank your lucky stars someone is taking a chance on you.</li></ul></div><hr><div><p>Be honest with yourself. There are limitations to what you can do right off the bat. You haven’t developed all the skills required to achieve everything. So know your limits, and set realistic targets, goals and ambitions.</p><p>Be honest with the people you work with or around. They’re your support network. Trust is a two-way street and you’ll need their trust to make anything of your new venture — so prioritise earning theirs first.</p><p>Be honest with clients. They’re the be all and end of business—without them you are and will be nothing. Honesty between you and your clients will help you to form strong relationships, and good relations with good clients is a hallmark of a successful business.</p><h2>How can you be more honest?</h2><ul><li><strong>You need to keep your word</strong>. If you make promises, you sure as hell better keep them. More importantly, make sure your actions match your words. Don’t practice this ‘do as I say, not as I do’ bullshit.</li><li><strong>Take responsibility.</strong> This means being willing to accept responsibility when things go wrong, and admitting a mistake or an error in judgment</li><li><strong>Develop a culture of openness</strong>. There is nothing worse than bad-mouthing someone behind their back. So get it out in the open. Just be sure to think before you speak because once it’s out, it’s out.</li></ul></div><hr><div><p>Jim Carrey hit the nail on the head with the following truth bomb: “You can fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.”</p><p>Don’t turn down great opportunities because of doubt, fear, or insecurity. Don’t hold back from new friendships, new business partnerships, and new clients. In the end, when the dust settles, you’ll only live to regret the missed possibilities.</p><p>When chasing success, risk is always going to be a huge part. It takes real guts to make the moves and decisions required to earn success, and sometimes you will have to bet big to get what you want.</p><p>So buckle up and throw down your chips. Fortune favours the brave.</p><p>Push your projects and ideas to the limit. Take on challenges that seem unsurpassable. Charge head first into the unknown. When you reach the outcomes, you will be surprised by what lies beyond there.</p><h2>How can you be braver?</h2><ul><li><strong>Acknowledge your fears.</strong> Identifying what is actually scaring you is the first step to overcoming them. Don’t hide them away. Bring them out in the open and begin to deal with them.</li><li><strong>Change your mindset</strong>. We spend too much time worrying about screwing up. But what about what could have been? Don’t fear failure. Fear regret.</li><li><strong>Find role models.</strong> At times in your journey, your head will drop and your spirits will be tested. It is important to have people you aspire to be like to help you motivate in those moments where you feel like giving up.</li></ul></div><hr><div><p>Life isn’t always rosy, and it isn’t always full of wins. So when you achieve goals, be sure to celebrate (at least a little bit).</p><p>Step back and reflect upon the accomplishments you make along the way. Every small step is really a big step, just on a really long ladder. Be amazed at your work. Allow yourself to feel that warm, proud feeling rise from your body.</p><p>It is such a simple thing to do, yet it’s constantly ignored as everyone pushes relentlessly towards their next objective. Of course momentum is necessary for success, but so is the occasional beer and revelling in self-glory.</p><p>This is great for your moral and your mental health. It will also help to motivate you and encourage you to push on towards the next objective.</p><p>And really, if you can’t enjoy your achievements, what’s the point in grafting so hard for them?</p><h2><strong>How to be more proud?</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Break your goals down</strong>. Learn to take a big task, and make it many smaller tasks. Use these smaller tasks to build up confidence, and momentum. Then you can see notable progress and think, “Whoa, I am doing bloody great!”</li><li><strong>Stop comparing yourself to others.</strong> If you constantly measure yourself against others, and others who are undoubtedly further ahead in their journey than you, then how are you ever going to feel proud of what you achieve?</li><li><strong>Don’t let others talk down your wins</strong>. There is always someone out there with a big mouth who will try to bring you down. You’ve just got to say <em>fuck them</em> and continue to believe in yourself.</li></ul></div><hr><div><p>And there you have it — my four principles: <strong>humility, honesty, bravery, </strong>and<strong> pride</strong>.

What happens when we die?”</p><p>The post garnered a slew of responses from users who used the forum not so much to answer the questions, but to recount their own encounters with God — or some version of a higher power — while under the influence of psychedelics. Throwawayuser626, for instance, chimes in with, “Personally, I don’t believe in God still, but the experiences I’ve had on heavy doses of acid and shrooms are something beyond human comprehension. It does make me ask myself if this is the afterlife that I’m seeing.”</p><p>Inf4nticide, who identifies as “agnostic-leaning-toward-atheist,” says that during one trip, God revealed himself and forced the user to make an unexplained life-changing choice. “I realize that I was tripping,” Inf4nticide writes, “but certain aspects of it were simply too real to dismiss.”</p><p>Another user, Neosapian, describes meeting a “warm female presence” who dispensed some truths about human nature that shifted the user’s perspective long after the trip ended: “For months, I felt a calm glow of acceptance.”</p><p>It’s easy to dismiss these stories as nothing more than the philosophizing of high people. But as it turns out, encounters with the divine while using psychedelics could be more than just fleeting hallucinations; they might actually have something to do with the therapeutic benefits of tripping.</p><blockquote>“One basic implication of this study is that this link between perceived oneness and life satisfaction occurs independent of your religious affiliation.”</blockquote><p>Research into psychedelics has ramped up in recent years as scientists study the potential of long-illicit drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA to treat everything from <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/whats-the-best-way-to-use-ketamine-for-depression-29a94af6d3c0">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/psychedelic-microdosing-depression-anxiety/584119/">anxiety</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/how-psychedelic-drugs-can-help-patients-face-death.html">fear of death</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25563446">addiction</a>. In the course of this research, psychologists and neuroscientists have noticed a pattern when cataloging people’s experiences in these altered states: A large portion of people describe mystical encounters similar to those found on r/LSD. And like Reddit user Neosapian, many say they are also left with a lasting glow.</p><p>Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine wanted to know how these experiences might affect people in the long term. Were these encounters with spirituality just fleeting apparitions, or could they actually be life-altering? With this in mind, the researchers conducted an anonymous online survey with over 4,000 participants who said they had experienced their own brush with the divine whether under the influence of drugs or not, which the researchers described as “the God of your understanding,” a “higher power,” an “ultimate reality,” or an “aspect or emissary of God.”</p><p>The resulting <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214377">study</a>, published in April in the journal <em>PLOS One</em>, looked at both drug-induced and non-drug induced encounters — 3,476 people surveyed reported having a mystical experience while under the influence of LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, or DMT, and another 809 people reported such encounters unprompted by psychedelics, though the study did not specify what may have been the trigger in these cases. The researchers recruited the participants through internet ads, private email invitations, and social media.</p><p>In both groups, the researchers found that a majority of respondents cited lasting positive changes in their psychological health following their experience — such as life satisfaction and increased purpose and meaning — sometimes even decades later.</p><p>What’s more, over two-thirds of the people in the psychedelics group who said they were atheists before their trip-induced encounter with God no longer identified that way afterward. Specifically, 21% of psychedelics users called themselves non-believers before and just 8% identified as such after.</p><p>On the whole, over two-thirds of the people in the study reported that their encounters involved communication with some entity having the attributes of consciousness, benevolence, intelligence, sacredness, or eternal existence. In fact, about 70% said that, although this mystical entity existed in another dimension or reality, they believed it continued to exist after the encounter, which could help explain their newfound spiritual identities as well as the lasting psychological benefits.</p><p>“Although modern Western medicine doesn’t typically consider ‘spiritual’ or ‘religious’ experiences as one of the tools in the arsenal against sickness, our findings suggest that these encounters often lead to improvements in mental health,” the study’s lead researcher, Roland Griffiths, PhD, said in a press release.</p><p>This study isn’t the first to look at the relationship between psychedelics and spirituality. The first major study of psychedelics and spirituality took place on Good Friday in 1962 in the basement of Marsh Chapel at Boston University. There, Harvard researchers (who were under the supervision of the famous psychologist Timothy Leary) gave LSD to 10 divinity students in hopes that it would trigger a mystical experience. Nine of those students said it did, and that it had a lasting impact.</p><p>“I had believed in God… but until the Good Friday experiment, I had no personal encounter with God,” one of those students, the late historian Huston Smith, later wrote. “The experience was powerful for me, and it left a permanent mark on my experienced worldview.” Smith eventually penned the philosophical text <em>Cleansing the Doors of Perception</em>, which explores the potential of psychedelic drugs as entheogens, a.k.a. “God-revealing chemicals.”</p><p>After the Good Friday experiment, other researchers began studying this phenomenon, too, but by the 1970s, psychedelics were banned and this mystical research ended altogether.</p><p>Griffiths, the lead author of this most recent study, has been paramount to reviving this area of study. In 2009, he conducted the <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104240746">first major study</a> of drugs and spirituality since the 1970s and has launched several more since. In a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5772431/">2018 study</a> looking at the use of psilocybin to treat addiction, depression, and anxiety in terminally ill people, Griffiths and his team found that study participants who reported having a mystical experience while on the drug were more likely to reap long-lasting psychological benefits, including life satisfaction, social relationships, spiritual awareness in everyday life, attitudes about life, self, mood, and behavior.</p><p>For that study, researchers gave psilocybin to people who also agreed to take on a spiritual practice such as meditation. The men and women were divided into three groups and were given different combinations of a high or low dose of psilocybin along with “moderate” to “high” support for their spiritual practice. After six months, the people who were given higher doses of the drug showed the most positive changes, including “interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life meaning/purpose, forgiveness, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, religious faith and coping, and community observer ratings,” according to the study.</p><p>While the results suggest that psychedelics could have a greater impact on the spirituality-happiness connection, <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rel-rel0000259.pdf">another April 2019 study</a> recently found that, beyond the use of psychedelics, people who feel a sense of “oneness,” or a connection to “a divine principle, life, the world, other persons, or even activities,” report higher levels of satisfaction in their lives than those who don’t. According to the study, these findings are regardless of religious affiliation. In fact, some religious affiliations had an insignificant or even negative impact on oneness feelings.</p><p>“I always felt that there is this relationship between feeling that everything is one, and being more satisfied with the state of the world or accepting how life is and understanding also why it is this way,” says the study’s author, Laura Edinger-Schons, a professor of corporate social responsibility at the University of Mannheim. “And one basic implication of this study is that this link between perceived oneness and life satisfaction occurs independent of your religious affiliation. That means that you could also just learn something about philosophy or take part in yoga classes or do some meditation.”</p><p>While the reasons are still unknown, the researchers argue that having a spiritual experience appears to improve people’s mental health, and the connection should be further studied. For now, the psychedelic-curious can join u/deftones_lover for some late-night mystical musing.</p></div></div>',

I knew we weren’t getting his money.</p><p>A week later I presented our plan to another investor. He said, “Your strategy is brilliant, Brett. It turns everything on it sides. I love it.”</p><p>The next week he called me and said, “I can’t get my partnership behind the idea, so I’m going to have to pass.”</p><p>My favorite rejection was from the late Paul Allen of Microsoft fame. Allen had a fund called Vulcan Ventures. We presented to one of Allen’s partners when we were raising our Series B funding.</p><p>The meeting went well, and I was excited to hear what the next steps were. The partner called me a few days later and said, “Paul just can’t get excited about the possibility of investing in low power analog ICs.”</p><p>Paul Allen wasn’t alone. A lot of investors couldn’t get excited about the possibility of investing in low power analog ICs.</p><p>The fact that many people didn’t believe in our idea doesn’t mean it was a bad idea. We were attacking a multi billion dollar market with a unique strategy and product set.</p><p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</p><p>You will find the same thing too. There will be some people that get your idea, and there will be many others that don’t get your idea.</p><p>The point is you have to have conviction about what you’re doing. If you don’t have conviction then nobody else will have conviction.</p><p>However, you can’t live in a bubble where you don’t listen to what the market or other knowledgable people are telling you. From day one we were hearing from investors a strong objection to the second source strategy we were using to get started.</p><p>On the one hand, we believed the strategy was the right way to start. On the other hand, it was also clear that we needed to make the long term vision of the company crystal clear.</p><p>The feedback made us better. We improved our messaging, and that helped us secure funding. Improving our messaging also helped us when started selling.</p><p>You’ll likely go through the same thing. The trick is determining what feedback to listen to, and what feedback to ignore. A simple rule that I find helpful is the more detailed the feedback, the more you should listen to the feedback.</p><p>There are very few businesses that don’t need to make some tweaks along the way to their strategy. We certainly were no exception.</p><p>We had two core assumptions that proved to be wrong. The first core assumption was that our second source products would sell quickly and pave the way for our proprietary products. The second source products sold slowly at the start. It was only when we announced proprietary products that the second source products started selling.</p><p>The second core assumption we got wrong was that the we needed the second source products to have credibility with our customers to sell our proprietary products. It turned out that our customers didn’t care whether we had a track record or not.</p><p>So we adjusted our strategy on only focused on highly differentiated proprietary products going forward. Again, the key for us, as it will be for you, was listening to the market, and looking at the cold hard facts.</p><p>I was talking with an entrepreneur the other day about his company. He said to me, “I’ve asked customers if they would buy my product and they said they would. That counts as validation, doesn’t it?”</p><p>I laughed and said, “No it doesn’t count as validation for your idea.”</p><p>He seemed taken aback. He asked, “Why doesn’t it?”</p><p>So, I told him, “The only true way to determine if you customers will pay for your product or service is for customers to actually pay for your product or service.”</p><p>There literally is no substitute for this step.</p><p>Let’s be honest. You’ve probably told someone yes to the, “Would you buy it at this price” question (or some form of it) at some point in your life.</p><p>For example, you probably told your kids (or your parents told you) you did a good job on something when the reality was quite different. Most people don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings.</p><p>But let’s say it costs money you don’t have to build your product, and you want to verify demand ahead of spending the money. One way you can get validation is by asking people to buy the product (at a discount) or provide a deposit.</p><p>It’s when a customer actually has to dig into their wallet that you know they’re serious. Even if the deposit is just $1.</p><p>The pre-revenue phase of building a company is a stage full of hope and excitement. You just know that customers are going to love what you’re building.</p><p>And if there is one thing that most of us fear as first time entrepreneurs, it’s asking to be paid. And the reason you fear asking to be paid is what if the customer says no.</p><p>That’s why asking to be paid is so scary. Reality hits you right in the face at the point.</p><p>Yeah, it sucks if your idea is worthless. It’s like the world is telling you that you’re not worthy. I get it.</p><p>However, you need to look at hearing that rejection in a totally different way. The question you need to be asking is, “What can we learn from what we are hearing?”</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Maybe your price is too high?</li><li>Maybe your product is not differentiated enough?</li><li>Maybe your emphasizing the wrong product benefits?</li><li>Maybe your pricing structure is wrong?</li><li>Maybe you’re trying to market and sell to the wrong set of customers?</li></ul><p>I’ve had all of these happen to me during my career. The key is trying to learn from what customers are telling you.</p><p>Sometimes you can make a minor adjustment and your business will take off. Other times, you need to move on to another opportunity.</p><p>The worst thing you can do is ignore what you’re hearing. Then you deserve everything that’s coming to you.</p><p>The reality is you only know whether your idea is good when, as the saying goes, “the dogs start eating the dog food.” So listen to the market, and make adjustments based on data. However, you only know if you have a great idea when customers actually start buying your products.</p><p>For more, read: <a href="http://www.brettjfox.com/what-are-the-five-skills-you-need-to-be-a-great-ceo/">What Are The Five Skills You Need To Be A Great CEO?</a>.

The closer you get to the road and the faster you go, the more important it is that you keep your senses focused on what is happening with the interface between the vehicle and the road. You need to understand the connection intimately.</p><p>Driving is a very modern activity that people have only been doing for a little over a century. It uses many parts of the brain as well as several different types of intelligence.</p><p>Several types? Yes. There isn’t just one. Intelligence isn’t just a number you get from taking an IQ test, or your GPA.</p><p><a href="https://howardgardner.com/multiple-intelligences/">Howard Gardener</a>, a developmental psychologist, described 7 types of intelligence in 1983. Over the years, he’s added a couple more (Naturalistic and Existential).</p><h4>What are they and how do I “train” them?</h4><p>Each intelligence is based on one unique way that we experience the world. While a traditional intelligence test only tries to measure a couple of these (usually some combination of Linguistic-Verbal, Logical-Mathematical and sometimes Visual-Spatial), what Gardener wants us to realize is that being smart is a much broader trait than we’ve imagined it to be.</p><p>You might be a genius in a few other categories of intelligence even if you find it a struggle to score in the 50% percentile of a written test.</p><p>This also means that there are more ways to increase your overall intelligence than we thought.</p><p><strong>Visual-Spatial</strong>: How well we relate to and interact with the three-dimensional world around us. I make a point to practice some still life drawing or work with 3D design software on a regular basis, and visit new places whenever I can in order to experience the world at a greater scale.</p><p><strong>Bodily-Kinesthetic</strong>: How well we manipulate objects and our own body. For this, I spend as much time as I can being physically active, and be sure to do so across multiple different activities that use a wide range of motor skills. I have children and energetic dogs which make it rather easy to join in on activities daily. I also try to work out several times a week, and vary this between running, swimming and strength training. I’ve never been much of an athlete, but if you are then you might even more challenging ways to improve this kind of intelligence. Rock climbing or gymnastics, anyone?</p><p><strong>Musical-Rhythmic</strong>: How well we recognize, reproduce and create pitch, rhythms, timbre and tone. I listen to music of many categories and hum (or drum) along. It’s very important to listen to both recorded and live music, as both experiences engage your mind and body in different ways. I’ve never seriously tried to compose music of my own, however, and I would expect that to be quite rewarding as well.</p><p><strong>Linguistic-Verbal</strong>: How well we think with and use words to describe complex thought and expression. I consider myself a writer and I do so about different subjects and have other people read and comment on my articles. I also write fiction and engage with other writers to help improve my skills. And whenever I have some opportunity to speak to new acquaintances or in front of groups of people, I do my best to be active and responsive in the conversation. Also falling under this category would be learning other languages aside from your native tongue. I try to stay conversant in Spanish, which I studied during high school and college, while also utilizing excellent tools like Duolingo to learn some useful words and phrases in other languages that I might have an opportunity to use at some point.</p><p><strong>Intrapersonal</strong>: How well we understand and describe our own thoughts and behaviors. For this particular type of intelligence, I keep a semi-regular journal and analyze my goals and feelings. I also try to read first-person literature, memoirs, and nonfiction (like <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</em> and <em>The Alchemist</em>).</p><p><strong>Existential</strong>: How well we are able to ponder and express thoughts about philosophical questions. I love to spark up conversations about complex matters and big question topics with friendly debaters who are up for a challenge. And I particularly enjoy studying topics like philosophy, religion, physics, astronomy and anthropology to keep up with new developments and understandings in those fields.</p><p><strong>Logical-Mathematical</strong>: How well we can quantify, understand logical operations, devise appropriate formulas and calculate answers to such problems. I’ve found that apps like Peak, Lumosity and Elevate are great for boosting this type of intelligence, as well as games like Sudoku. I also learn a lot of concepts for free on Khan Academy and then challenge myself every day by trying to solve for various everyday physics problems (like how fast you need to travel to get from point A to point B by a certain time). I’ve also made a point of learning the basics of a new programming language ever few months — I’m currently doing some GoLang tutorials.</p><p><strong>Interpersonal</strong>: How well we interact and empathize with other people. How to train: This is all about focusing on other people. Whenever I’m with other people, whether they are friends and family, new acquaintances, or work colleagues, I make a concerted effort to be an active listener, show that I care, promote a calm and rational conversation and try to fully understand other points of view.</p><p><strong>Naturalistic</strong>: How well we recognize differences, similarities and usefulness among natural objects, including animals, plants and geographic features. As animals, we have millions of years of inherited traits that make us well suited to living in the natural world, but most of us don’t use these instincts on a regular basis. To increase my own naturalistic intelligence, then, I spend time outdoors and among nature, focusing on using my senses to observe and investigate the world around me. Again, having my children and dogs is an added encouragement to get outside often. And when the weather is too rough, I can curl up on the couch with one of the many wonderful Peterson Field Guide or Falcon Nature Guide books.</p><p>It’s all too easy to fall into a rut in which you might only be using a few types of intelligence. Years of doing so is bound to dull those intelligences that are being ignored, so it takes some conscious planning to make sure you are always allowing time to exercise all nine of Gardener’s pillars. Once you do make this a part of your life, though, you will find that every type of intelligence reinforces the others:</p><p>Bodily-Kinesthetic and Musical-Rhythmic, together, will help you be a better dancer.</p><p>Intrapersonal and Interpersonal, combined, will make you a better manager or leader.</p><p>A great lawyer needs to be well-practiced in Logical-Mathematical, Linguistic-Verbal and Interpersonal skills.</p><p>A paleontologist must rely on Naturalistic and Visual-Spatial intelligence in their excavations, and needs the Logical-Mathematical and Linguistic-Verbal skills to analyze and communicate findings.</p><p>If there is one lesson to be learned from this, it’s that we shouldn’t ignore any of our nine intelligences, and we shouldn’t favor only a few at the expense of others.</p><p>Thank you for reading and sharing!</p></div></div>',

As we sleep, visual and audio fragments combine into nonsensical snippets and epic narratives. Loosely recalled moments merge with vivid, imagined scenes; we interact with characters known and characters conjured up; we explore our fantasies and, sometimes, face our fears. Yet sleeping and dreaming do not exist for our nocturnal pleasure alone.</p><p>As we slumber, our brains filter information collected in waking hours. Neurological processes spring into action. They discard what is irrelevant and consolidate what is important; they form and store memories. These mechanisms — found throughout the mammal world — are so effective that a team of Italian researchers have mathematically modeled them for use in artificial intelligence.</p><p>The result is an algorithm that expands the storage capacity of artificial networks by forcing them into an off-line sleep phase during which they reinforce relevant memories (pure states) and erase irrelevant ones (spurious states).</p><h3><strong>When math meets mammals</strong></h3><p>Adriano Barra is a theoretical physicist at the University of Salento in Italy. Barra is eager and animated when he speaks to me, frequently using a pack of Marlboro cigarettes as an unlikely prop to illustrate the finer points of A.I.</p><p>Along with his colleagues Elena Agliari and Alberto Fachechi, Barra studies complex systems, such as brains, and makes mathematical models of their neurobiology. “We theoretical physicists have a teeny advantage over engineers,” says Barra. “As the mathematics is the same, almost for free, we can apply our results in artificial intelligence. We are a bridge between neurobiology and engineering.”</p><p>The classic blueprint for artificial neural networks is the Hopfield model. Developed by John Hopfield in 1982, it describes how artificial networks learn and retrieve information using mechanisms, such as pattern recognition, that mimic real brains. The most popular learning rule for a Hopfield network is Hebbian learning, which proposes how the synapses between neurons are strengthened during the learning process.</p><p>There is a drawback, however. The Hopfield model is now decades old, and can only store a limited amount of information. Expressed mathematically, the maximum storage capacity for this symmetric network<strong> </strong>is α∼0.14. However, the theoretical limit is 1, or α=1.</p><blockquote>Networks in an awake, or online, state are always learning new patterns of information. As well as desirable patterns, however, they collect irrelevant, even fake patterns.</blockquote><p>A network’s capacity is determined by the number of neurons (<em>n</em>) it contains. Each bit of information, such as a digital pixel, is a distinct pattern (<em>p</em>) of information. “You can store, at maximum, a number of patterns that is <em>p</em> equal to 0.14 times <em>n</em>,” says Barra.</p><p>Why, then, is the storage capacity only a fraction of what is theoretically possible? Why is it 0.14, rather than 1?</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*O0brPUhO7ZmYhc24QEY-BQ.jpeg?q=20"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*O0brPUhO7ZmYhc24QEY-BQ.jpeg"></p></div></figure><p>Networks in an awake, or online, state are always learning new patterns of information. As well as desirable patterns, however, they collect irrelevant, even fake patterns. “You get the network to store these important patterns but unavoidably it will also store mistakes,” says Barra. “You cannot avoid them. They are automatically generated.”</p><p>He grabs his Marlboros and compares them to a pack of Camel cigarettes. “If you keep storing details about these packets of cigarettes — the blue one is Camel and the red one is Marlboro, etc. — but you also take in all the redundant information, the network eventually gets stuck.” Jammed with irrelevant and spurious information, maximum capacity is reached at 0.14.</p><p>This limited capacity<strong> </strong>does not stop A.I. from carrying out specific tasks, but clogging up valuable space with useless data is wasteful and inefficient.<strong> </strong>The Italian team’s solution is an algorithm that forces networks into an off-line phase that echoes mammal sleep, which is used to reinforce important memories and erase irrelevant ones.</p><p>“It is deeply related to sleep,” says Barra, “because if you don’t get rid of all these spurious mistakes, they become too much, and the network is no longer able to discriminate between what is a Marlboro and what is a Camel.”</p><h3><strong>Freeing up space</strong></h3><p>Mammalian brains are also constantly collecting new patterns of information. But like a fishing boat indiscriminately trawling the seabed, along with relevant information\u00ad, they also suck up unimportant details.</p><p>“When you are awake, you store a lot of information passively; you don’t really need it and don’t really want to store it,” says Barra. “We also produce spurious and fake patterns of information. We want to get rid of that. We do this by sleeping.”</p><p>During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the phase of sleep in which we usually dream, our brains are busy erasing irrelevant memories. This makes room for storing new ones. In slow-wave (SW) sleep, important memories are reinforced. While most dreaming occurs during REM, we may experience indistinct dreams that are harder to recall during SW sleep.</p><p>The research team knew that mammalian brains use highly efficient mechanisms to clear out storage space during sleep. Their analysis of this fact was the starting point for their algorithm.</p><p>“We said, okay, let’s go through the neurobiological paper that explains this phenomenon in a real brain and try to model it mathematically,” says Barra. “Then we asked: What can happen if we apply this mathematical backbone to the Hopfield model?”</p><blockquote>Evolution has provided the criteria mammalian brains rely upon to determine what should be consolidated and what should be erased, but artificial networks need people to take on the task.</blockquote><p>Their answer is presented in a paper published in<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608019300176"> <em>Neural Networks</em></a><em> </em>in April<em>.</em> Under the new framework, artificial networks continue to learn and store patterns of information (as memories) during standard online, or awake, sessions. However, when storage capacity hits 0.14, the network is forced into an off-line, or sleep, session. This sleep phase is used to delete irrelevant information and consolidate the important stuff, or more technically, for “spurious-pattern removal and pure-pattern reinforcement.” By implementing a new off-line regimen, the team was able to free up storage space and increase capacity to 1.</p><p>Evolution has provided the criteria mammalian brains rely upon to determine what should be consolidated and what should be erased, but artificial networks need people to take on the task. “They [networks] are absolute slaves of our perception, so we have to say to them, ‘This is important, pay attention to it. This is not important,’” says Barra. “They don’t have the concept of importance.”</p><p>There are other technical differences too. For instance, in human brains, erasing and consolidation occur during two distinct stages of sleep (REM and SW); when networks sleep, both tasks happen simultaneously. Perhaps the thing that most distinguishes human from machine sleep is that we have autonomy over our slumber and naps. Artificial networks’ sleep sessions are triggered by math — no cozy blanket required.</p><p>With the new framework in the public sphere, Barra’s job is over. “I am a theoretical physicist; I develop the mathematical backbone,” he says. “Now it is a matter for the engineers to implement it.” And maybe he — and artificial networks — can take a well-deserved nap.</p></div></div>',

And then she <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/famous-women-failure-quotes">got herself fired</a>.</p><p>It can be hard to imagine someone like Wintour — perfectly polished, perceived as the best in her field, respected to the point of being feared — ever making a misstep. But the photo shoots that Wintour arranged were deemed by senior editorial staff to be too “edgy,” a sign of poor judgment and lack of fit.</p><p>Wintour’s signature eye for edgy fashion spreads is, of course, a huge part of her present-day reputation. Her failure almost 50 years ago is directly connected to her enormous success today. And, as she told Alistair Campbell for his book <em>Winners: And How They Succeed</em>, everyone should be fired at least once in his or her career, and setbacks are important “because that is the reality of life.”</p><p>Not everyone has a failure story as public as the world’s top fashion editor. In other professions, people fail a lot more quietly — over email, for example, or in papers that get buried in a bottom drawer. Failure can be a source of shame, a sign that someone isn’t good enough or smart enough or can’t get on the right track.</p><p>But it’s not just Anna Wintour who has learned to value setbacks. I’ve <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/everything-learned-about-failure/">learned a lot</a> about failure over the last 13 years as I’ve built <a href="https://www.jotform.com/">JotForm</a>, a business with over 4.9 million users. As a CEO, I have long valued failure as the flipside of risk: If you’re committed to a big vision, you’re going to occasionally have big letdowns.</p><p>But CEOs aren’t the only ones who have learned to think more constructively about failure. The paths taken by scientists, writers, educators and entrepreneurs can also provide ways to view failure as a form of inspiration instead of a black mark on your permanent record.</p><blockquote><p>“Failure is the greatest teacher.” — Udai Yadla</p></blockquote><p>Capable educators do something crucial that we can all learn from: They turn failure into a teachable moment. After all, if you learn from an experience, if it makes you better or stronger or faster, if it clarifies your direction or refines your purpose, then how can anything truly be perceived as a failure?</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*0-T1W3j1c61zT0zxWL_u-A.jpeg?q=20"></p><p><img></p></div></div></figure><p>Leaders learn this lesson early: <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/how-to-approach-failure/">Make failure productive</a>.</p><p>I’ve learned to implement this idea and look at failure as a chance to do things better. What did we miss the first time around, how can we improve, and what other blind spots exist?</p><p>The very idea that failure can have an educational purpose has even inspired a new interdisciplinary facility at Columbia University: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/04/the-value-of-failing/558848/">Education for Persistence and Innovation Center</a>, part of the Teachers College.</p><p>We need to drag failure out of the dark. One professor wrote <a href="https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7322-467a">a journal article</a> recommending that academics keep a “CV of failures” to “log every unsuccessful application, refused grant proposal and rejected paper” — and make it public in a bid to help normalize failure as a key part of the path to success.</p><p>Receptiveness to this perspective should start early. <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/edu-edu0000092.pdf">Research</a> has also shown that when students are taught that success isn’t linear, when they see that even Albert Einstein tripped up on occasion, their grades and motivation improve.</p><p>And when parents have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/06/476884049/how-to-teach-children-that-failure-is-the-secret-to-success">a more positive attitude</a> towards failure — seeing failure as an opportunity instead of a sign of limitations — then their children have an expanded sense of possibility and are less likely to believe that intelligence is fixed.</p><blockquote><p>“I have not failed; I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” — Thomas Edison</p></blockquote><p><span>I</span>magine if Thomas Edison had given up on any of his early attempts to create a light bulb? Edison famously failed — over and over and over. And then he found a way that worked. And then he changed the world.</p><p>Failure is at the very root of scientific inquiry. Long before the breakthrough, dotting the path to medical innovations and technological advances, failure is a crucial part of the process. Scientists accept failure not as some grand sign that they are doomed to mediocrity but rather as a way to refine the way forward.</p><p>For scientists, failing is normal. After all, the failure rate for secondary clinical drug trials is said to be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3974547/#R5">over 80 percent</a>. And a whopping <a href="https://psmag.com/environment/science-needs-to-fail">90 percent</a> of experimental drugs and therapies fail to complete the process from early development to Food &amp; Drug Administration approval.</p><p>We spend too much time celebrating success and not enough time appreciating failure. A little more transparency might help — which is exactly what many scientists are advocating for.</p><p>If we could see the first, second and hundredth attempts at eventual success, the hypotheses that proved wrong, it might serve as an encouragement to keep on track with our own world-changing ideas.</p><blockquote><p>“Failure is so important. We speak about success all the time. It is the ability to resist failure or use failure that often leads to greater success. I’ve met people who don’t want to try for fear of failing.” — J.K. Rowling</p></blockquote><p>The story of author J.K. Rowling and her Harry Potter series is now something of a legend: She was an impoverished single parent with a wild imagination who persevered to write some of the modern world’s most beloved books.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*98L1OgiCzg8fy0DUiXjBZw.jpeg?q=20"></p><p><img></p></div></div></figure><p>Rowling started writing the Harry Potter series when she had a newborn baby and was living off of welfare benefits. There can be no doubt that she has always been both smart and talented, but her life had taken an undesirable turn.</p><p>But Rowling didn’t internalize her situation and simply decide to give up. She accepted her setback but knew she could do better. And so she got to work, eventually overcoming her circumstances in an almost unimaginable way.</p><p>Rowling is now one of the richest women in the world.</p><p>Despite her failings, she decided to keep reaching. Rowling decided to treat failure as a temporary condition — one that could be overcome with some determination. She applied her imagination not simply to the stories she was writing, but also to her own potential.</p><p>And if she could envision a big, extraordinary world for Harry Potter, then she could do the same for her own life.</p><blockquote><p>“Achievement seems to be connected with action. Successful men and women keep moving. They make mistakes but they don’t quit.” — Conrad Hilton</p></blockquote><p><span>F</span>ear of failure can be so powerful that many people lead their lives to minimize risk. With every step, they calculate the safest possible move. They watch money grow slowly in a savings account, hold onto jobs that are unfulfilling but steady, and never say no to a sure thing.</p><p>I can understand the caution that underpins that perspective, but it can also limit potential. For many entrepreneurs, the bottom is this: If you’re not willing to take some pretty big risks, then you won’t ever see the big rewards.</p><p>The risk-reward relationship isn’t new, and it’s certainly not exclusive to entrepreneurs. (You might run into some high rollers in Vegas who like to make the same argument.)</p><p>But here’s another, complementary insight from people who build their own businesses from the ground up, including me: Accomplishing something that was immensely challenging and doing the seemingly impossible is far more rewarding than simply humming along and never having to make any hard choices or admit you made a mistake.</p><p>And that’s a lesson that entrepreneurs learn over and over about failure: Failure is a sign that you’re trying. It’s a sign that you want more and that you’re willing to fight for it. You won’t always get it right, and the payoff won’t always be clear. But if you hang in there, and you get back up, your sense of accomplishment will triumph over any rewards a sense of certainty can offer.</p></div></div></div>',

As a way to cope, she organized her life so that she never had to develop intimate relationships: She conceived her children via an anonymous donor and padded her schedule with nonstop work, further graduate school, and volunteering. But it didn’t help.</p><p>Powell was increasingly plagued by flashbacks, and began having panic attacks. When on a tram entering the park at Disney World with her best friend, she was seated next to a man who reeked of beer and stale cigarettes, an aroma that reminded her of her abuser; the smell so unnerved her that her heart began racing, and she had to leap off the train at the park’s entrance and collect herself. She was so triggered by her teenage daughter’s deadbeat boyfriend — he had been caught doing drugs, which reminded her of the unstable environment in her childhood home — that she began screaming and cursing at the young lovers one day when she caught them on the phone, only to look up and see the tear-stained face of her terrified younger son. “I realized I was parenting them from the place of a frightened child,” she told me.</p><p>She assumed something was wrong with her. “I thought I had some genetic defect,” she says. But it was the movie <em>Frozen</em>, which features a heroine forced to hide a magical power (“Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know…<em>”</em>), that made Powell realize what was happening: The trauma she had tried to bury for decades was negatively impacting every aspect of her life.</p><p>Not long after viewing the movie, Powell visited an internet forum for sexual abuse survivors. The other users encouraged her to find a therapist who specialized in trauma. Some suggested she specifically look into Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy, or EMDR, which involves therapist-led eye movements to help lessen the impact of traumatic memories. “It seemed crazy that moving my eyes back on forth was going to change anything,” she said, but considering the talk therapy she’d undergone in the past hadn’t helped, she was willing to give something unconventional a try.</p><p>EMDR is one of a growing number of therapeutic methods that promise faster relief from everyday ruts to diagnosed mental illness, and everything in between. Multiple hospitals and research centers across the country are now offering short, intensive treatment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/health/ocd-concentrated-therapy-cbt.html">programs</a> lasting anywhere from two days to two weeks, most catering to people with trauma-related issues, phobias, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or anxiety disorders. Some other short-term therapies, including Accelerated Resolution Therapy and hypnosis-based protocols, are also gaining traction among those with more everyday worries. Proponents say the limited time commitments enable more people to access help, allowing them to get back to their jobs, schooling, and families faster. But are treatments that prize brevity inherently more accommodating and patient-friendly, or are they just playing into our contemporary obsession with optimization at the expense of long-lasting healing and growth?</p></div></div><div><div><p>EMDR was created by a woman named Francine Shapiro in the late 1980s, when she was a graduate student in psychology studying stress. As she tells it, EMDR was discovered by accident: She was out for a walk one day, and she began thinking of distressing things. She says she doesn’t remember what those distressing thoughts were anymore, but in her book <em>EMDR: The Breakthrough Therapy for Overcoming Anxiety, Stress, and Trauma, </em>she describes them as “just one of those nagging negative thoughts that the mind keeps chewing over.”</p><p>Simultaneously Shapiro says she noticed that while ruminating, her eyes were “making rapid repetitive movements on a diagonal from lower left to upper right.” Her thoughts quickly “shifted from consciousness” — another way of saying she mentally moved on. She was curious as to what had happened, so she purposely brought the thoughts back, but she discovered that they no longer had the same impact as they did before.</p><p>Eager to explore her discovery further, Shapiro experimented on 22 people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which had just years earlier been formally recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. She told her subjects to think of a traumatic memory and then to follow her fingers as she moved them in front of their faces, mimicking the way she felt her eyes moved in the park. When her findings were later published in the <em>Journal of Traumatic Stress</em> in 1989, she asserted that 100% of her test subjects reported they were no longer anguished by a traumatic memory after a single session of EMDR.</p><p>Modern EMDR sessions have a similar format. A trained therapist takes the patient’s history and explains the treatment protocol, a process can last for more than one session. Then, the therapist will ask the patient to describe a single traumatic memory, image, or a negative feeling (for example, someone who suffered abuse as a child might tackle the belief that they are fundamentally unlovable). As the person is talking, the therapist moves his or her finger bilaterally in the person’s field of vision while the patient tracks it (other types of stimuli, including finger taps on the knee or pulsating handheld apparatuses, are sometimes used). A session usually lasts around 45–75 minutes, with the ocular tracking often done in 15 or 30-second increments, depending on the severity of the trauma (there are a number of demonstrations you can watch on YouTube, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B122emzNPSU">this</a> one.)</p><p>Why EMDR might be effective is very unclear. In a 2018 <a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/using-emdr-therapy-to-heal-your-past-interview-with-creator-francine-shapiro/">interview</a>, Shapiro’s own explanations of why rapid eye movement works are vague — “during [a session] the brain makes the needed connections that transform the ‘stuck memory’ into a learning experience and take it to an adaptive resolution.”</p><p>One popular theory — that’s bolstered by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11748597">research</a> conducted by psychiatrist Robert Stickgold at Harvard University — is that the eye movements induced during EMDR mimic what happens during deep sleep when the brain is believed to sift through the day’s events and process them, serving as a kind of digestive system for the psyche. Molly Bahr, a licensed mental health counselor who practices EMDR in Miami, Florida, believes that “[The ocular tracking] helps the brain take what it needs (lessons, skills), and leave the rest. [It’s] part of why we can go to bed angry and wake up feeling much better.”</p><p>Another hypothesis is that the eye movements tax the brain’s working memory, essentially distracting the patient, thereby diminishing the impact of the recalled memory and allowing the patient to revisit it without as much fear and panic.</p><p>Studies have shown EMDR can yield positive results in a few sessions: One, funded by HMO Kaiser Permanente, found that 100% of the single-trauma victims and 77% of multiple-trauma victims no longer met the criteria PTSD after six 50-minute sessions — and all without the patient having to talk about the trauma at length or do substantial homework, as in conventional exposure therapy. Powell says her first experience with EMDR was nothing short of “miraculous;” another EMDR patient, Ryan Nelson of South Carolina — who sought treatment after the brutal murder of her best friend — says she quickly lost her fear of knives and of being alone thanks to the therapy. “At the end of each session, you come out and you’ve come to a better end,” she says.</p><p>Though EMDR was formulated with PTSD in mind, Shapiro and other EMDR practitioners have widened the pool of potential beneficiaries. Shapiro has said that EMDR might be effective for people with chronic pain, autism, fibromyalgia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, addiction, relationship problems, and even proclivities towards sexual violence. In her self-help book <em>Getting Past Your Past</em>, Shapiro contends that EMDR and EMDR-adjacent relaxation exercises can help “Olympic athletes to achieve peak performance and… people prepare for challenges like presentations, job interviews, and social situations.” Up until now, a sizable majority of the research on EMDR has focused on straightforward PTSD or cases where trauma has preceded another diagnosis like depression or Borderline Personality Disorder, so most of the other benefits touted are either based in anecdote or conjecture.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Other short therapies like EMDR include Accelerated Resolution Therapy, or ART. Like EMDR, ART was originally designed to treat trauma, but is also said to help depression, OCD, codependency, work stress, low self-esteem, and more. After undergoing EMDR training, Laney Rosenzweig, a marriage and family counselor, developed ART as her own protocol. Like EMDR, ART uses therapist-led eye movements, but incorporates elements of Gestalt and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, among other modalities. It differs from EMDR in a few ways, including that it is a more somatically focused (patients are asked to focus on how their body feels during therapy) and a more rigidly structured protocol, which proponents <a href="https://acceleratedresolutiontherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ART-vs-EMDR_by-Hoge.pdf">say</a> results in a “more rapid desensitization.” EMDR is marketed as the gentler option to exposure therapy because patients spend minimal time revisiting their trauma, but ART takes that to a new level by not requiring patients to describe their traumas. The practice <a href="http://acceleratedresolutiontherapy.com/how-art-works/">is said to</a> reprogram the ways in which traumatic memories are stored in the brain so that “they no longer trigger strong physical and emotional reactions.”</p><p>According to the Rosenzweig Center for Rapid Recovery, a professional organization based in Orlando, Florida, people can experience relief from symptoms after one to five sessions using ART. And they can do it without having to do homework, take any medication, or even talk about the trauma at all. All that being said, there have only been three studies on the therapy to date. “The most difficult aspect of discussing ART,” Rosenzweig has said, “is that it sounds too good to be true.” The research thus far is minimal: as of 2018, just a handful of case studies had been done on ART, and the only one to feature a control group <a href="https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/178/12/1298/4267504">concluded</a> that “ART appears to be a safe and effective treatment for symptoms of combat-related PTSD.”</p><p>Another therapy gaining traction — at least in my area of Brooklyn — is Rapid Transformational Therapy, a type of hypnotherapy that “aims to deliver permanent change in 1–3 sessions,” according to the <a href="https://rapidtransformationaltherapy.com/whatisrtt/?_ga=2.177863717.1211590574.1558901395-470467729.1529073182">website</a> of founder Marisa Peer, a British hypnotherapist and author. RTT is more explicitly a panacea than EMDR and ART: a promotional video on Peer’s site states RTT helps “improve overall well-being,” and testimonials credit it with a range of results from clearing up skin acne to alleviating depression to curing fear of public speaking. On a recent Monday afternoon in May I left my husband juggling my two young sons and a conference call to undergo a session.</p><p>In RTT, after the practitioner takes a basic history, you’re put into a state of hypnosis in order to “access the subconscious.” The practitioner then prompts you to see key scenes from your childhood, probes you about how those scenes contributed to your problematic current-day worldview, and instructs you on how to let go of them, using a combination of free dialog (much like traditional talk therapy) and scripted verbal exercises in which you renounce your past beliefs.</p><p>When I arrived at my therapist’s house for my own RTT session, I practically collapsed onto the couch while unleashing a torrent of worries: the difficulties of parenting two small children with a largely absent husband, the fear of failing (at work, at motherhood, at life), the residual anxiety leftover from the difficult and premature birth of my second son, the feeling that I’m constantly deprived of time to do basically anything. I breathed in the pleasant lavender aroma as the therapist sympathetically nodded along, then coaxed me into a dream-like state. I was told to lie down, close my eyes and envision that I was walking slowly down a flight of stairs. By the time I was at the bottom, I felt awake, but less inhibited and a bit woozy, almost a little drunk. When I left to make my way home, I tripped over a large garbage bag and into the street in an attempt to hail a taxi, probably prompting some bystanders to think I was drunk.</p><p>At the session’s conclusion, the practitioner sends you home with a personalized recording — mine is just over 15 minutes long, and functions as a kind of miniature version of the session, reminding me that I’ve moved on from my childhood and that I’m now operating in my “zone of genius,” which might be my new favorite empowering aphorism. You’re meant to listen to the recording daily for at least 21 days.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Short-term therapy methods, especially EMDR, have their detractors. Critics call into question everything from Shapiro’s schooling — her degree is from a never-accredited, now-defunct graduate school — to experimenter bias prevalent in early EMDR research studies. A 1999 <a href="https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/14-05-21/#feature">article</a> by three psychologists in <em>Skeptic</em> magazine outlined how Shapiro and EMDR advocates tended to tweak the definitions of good EMDR practices over time: When studies began showing less-than-stellar results for EMDR, proponents claimed the practitioners needed further training, or that they had recently determined that other forms of stimulation such as knee-tapping could also be efficacious. “The shifting procedures and training requirements for EMDR have created a seemingly endless catch-up game for scientists,” the psychologists wrote. “How can scientists test a method whose proponents insist on treatment fidelity for the induction of eye movements, then state that alternate tapping strategies are possible, next argue that various protocols must be followed, and then switch the decision rules for those protocols?”</p><p>Doubters and champions have also argued incessantly over whether the eye movements are a necessary component or just a neat parlor trick employed solely to distinguish EMDR from more conventional exposure-based therapies. A 2001 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11393607">study</a> in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology — just one of a number of early studies to zero in on the eye movements themselves — concluded bluntly that “EMDR appears to be no more effective than other exposure techniques, and evidence suggests that the eye movements integral to the treatment, and to its name, are unnecessary.” When a 2013 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23266601">meta-analysis</a> published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry indicated that the addition of eye movements did further desensitize patients to traumatic memories, a trio of prominent psychologists published a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/sdfe/pdf/download/eid/1-s2.0-S0005791613000785/first-page-pdf">critique</a> in the same journal accusing the meta-analysis authors of, among other infractions, including studies that used students instead of actual PTSD sufferers, counting two favorable study more than once and “cherry-picking” the studies that had favorable outcomes. “Having set-up the meta-analysis exclusion criteria,” the psychologists write, “[the meta-analysis authors] accordingly exclude large numbers of studies which tested this exact phenomenon for various reasons of technicality or preference.”</p><p>There is also an ideological concern, mostly held by classical psychoanalysts and psychotherapists, over the brevity of treatment itself, the fact that studies often don’t follow patients long-term (this is a problem in most psychological and psychiatric studies), and the way EMDR tackles single memories at a time rather than view the patient holistically. Beneath this discussion lies another critical one, about whether painful emotions serve a purpose, and about whether we should be attempting to hack our way to mental health in ever-more expeditious ways.</p><p>Jonathan Shedler, PhD, a psychologist who has <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychologically-minded/201711/selling-bad-therapy-trauma-victims">written</a> about the false promise of short-term therapies for trauma, objects to the idea that you can spot-treat in counseling. “The kind of problems that bring people to therapy — with rare exceptions — are really woven into the person’s way of experiencing the world,” he says. “So when you say, ‘I’m going to treat this problem in isolation,’ you’re already saying something that doesn’t fit the reality.”</p><p>For Shedler, a therapist offering an accelerated cure is like a trainer offering to transform a slouch into a pro-weightlifter in a snap: “If you were physically out of shape and in poor health and overweight, and I said, ‘I’m going to get you fit and trim and muscular and you’re going to be in peak physical condition,’ people ought to understand this is going to take serious hard work over time.” He cites <a href="http://www.personal.kent.edu/~dfresco/CBT_Readings/JCCP_Lambert_2001.pdf">research</a> that pooled information from 10,000 therapy patients, who presented with a variety of ailments including anxiety, mood disorders, and personal stress, that showed it takes more than 40 sessions of treatment — at a standard one session a week, that’s a little over nine months — for 75% of patients to show “meaningful improvement,” which doesn’t necessarily mean they were “cured.”</p><p>“The moment somebody makes a claim and it falls pretty far outside those general parameters, I think there’s really good reason to be suspicious,” he says.</p><p>Why should we expect healing to take that long? One reason might be because the driving force behind healing in therapy is what’s known as the “therapeutic alliance” — the trust patients have that the therapist likes them and has their best interests at heart. Numerous <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198542/">studies</a> have shown the strength of the therapeutic alliance to be the number one indicator of treatment outcome, with the type of therapy mattering little if at all (this conclusion has been contested when it comes to certain problems, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/jan/23/psychological-therapies-mental-illness-dodo-bird-verdict">bulimia</a> or specific phobias).</p><p>Simply put, people do better when they have a strong relationship with their therapist. And like most good relationships, this one often takes time to develop. The venerable psychoanalyst Irvin Yalom, in his recent book <em>The Gift of Therapy: An Open Letter to a New Generation of Therapists and Their Patient</em>s, bemoans rigid treatment methodologies — those taught from manuals or in short certification courses, like EMDR — because they tend to stunt the development of a bond between patient and therapist: “Therapists must convey to the patient that their paramount tasks is to build a relationship together that will itself become the agent of change. It is extremely difficult to teach this skill in a crash course using a protocol.”</p><p>EMDR advocates say people who decry the therapy as a quick fix have mischaracterized it, and that Dr. Shapiro herself has never claimed that a patient could be cured in a single session, that five sessions was the average amount of time it took for most patients to recover. But that is still significantly faster than the traditional therapies studied in the analysis of 10,000 cases. Although many of the published studies on EMDR focus on short courses of treatment, most of the consumers I spoke to had been doing it off and on longer than five sessions.</p><p>Despite the criticism, EMDR continues to make inroads into the institutions that set the standards for treating mental illness. In the past 20 years, EMDR has been recognized as an effective treatment for trauma by the American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization; the United States Department of Defense classifies it as a “first-line” treatment for trauma, meaning it’s “recommended for all trauma populations at all times,” according to the EMDR Institute in Watsonville, California, a professional organization founded by Francine Shapiro. Despite this endorsement, the VA still <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/05/31/alternate-ptsd-therapy-vets-ruffles-va-feathers-shows-results.html">prefers</a> to employ more conventional exposure therapy.</p></div></div><div><div><p>It’s been four years since her first EMDR session, but Traci Powell continues to get the treatment. On average, she attends therapy twice a week, and does EMDR at one of those sessions. She had hoped for the quick relief she had read about in the research, but she says that she often self-sabotaged early on in the process. She’d be so anxious about revisiting traumatic memories that she’d sometimes refuse to do the eye movements themselves. She chalks up her early resistance to the fact that her PTSD is complex and the result of trauma sustained in childhood.</p><p>Though the process has been longer for her than for many of the test subjects EMDR proponents cite, Powell says she’s made more progress in the last six months than in the preceding five years. In fact, she’s become comfortable enough talking about her abuse that she’s built a side career as a mental health <a href="https://www.therebuiltwoman.com/">advocate</a> and vocal sex abuse survivor, for which she credits EMDR. “You have to work up the courage to step into it,” she told me. “Fear is what holds us back.”</p><p>As for me, I’m not a meditation person, but in the days after my RTT session, I diligently listened to my recording. Hearing the practitioner’s voice assure me I was endlessly capable must have clicked some switch, because I did find myself feeling more resilient and energetic. Was it just the collateral benefit of unburdening myself to someone kind and understanding, or some mysterious, fast-acting component of RTT? Like Powell, I may never know for sure.</p></div></div></div></div>',

It’s a one or the other kind of game and makes you wonder which once you should pick up, especially when you’re just entering the fray.</p><p>Since Facebook changed React’s BSD licensing to MIT, the library appears to be exploding in every corner of the global development market. However, what a lot of entrepreneurs and startups don’t realize until later down the line is that React isn’t a complete front end system — it is just one library, one building block of many to help quickly scale a small application into larger, compartmentalized and component based system.</p><h3>The React vs Angular debate</h3><p>Facebook is often used as the prime example of its success. But React is only a tiny drop in the multitude of technologies the tech giant employs. It is after all, just a JavaScript UI library.</p><p>Angular, however, is a collection of libraries that work together a cohesive unit.</p><p>There are things that Angular do well that React omits, while other theoretical implementations of the latter is much better executed. Developers will always be biased towards what they know best and as a result, refuse to look into other paradigms that may be better suited for the situation — or perhaps this kind of thinking is often regulated to those who sits at the junior and intermediate levels.</p><p>Despite React’s rise in popular, Angular still continues to have strong support from an equally, if not larger, tech giant known as Google. Conferences and developer advocates are equally strong for both JavaScript based front end methodologies. However, we may have another rising underdog that sits in between Angular and React in terms of offerings.</p><h3>We need to talk about Vue</h3><figure><div><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*rXBv1VkquEDsyIlglq0V4g.jpeg?q=20"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rXBv1VkquEDsyIlglq0V4g.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Data from Google Trends. Red = Angular. Blue = React. Yellow = Vue.</figcaption></figure><p>Vue is the newest kid on the block and is gently creeping up in popularity, turning React into the popular middle child of the trio. While the community is much smaller than Angular and React, it is gaining in popularity due to it being lightweight, not as complicated as Angular but offers more than React’s core functionalities.</p><p>The creator of Vue actually has a background in AngularJS, which is much more aligned with the principles of React than the current version and methodologies of Angular we know.</p><h3>Ease of adoption and developer avocation</h3><p>React is undisputedly easy to pick up and transform into a fully fleshed out application that is native mobile app conversion friendly and is popular in the newbie developers circle.</p><p>Angular requires a bit more heavy lifting and overhead learning to get started, borrowing concepts and ideologies from Java, a predominantly backend technology that dominates Google’s code infrastructure. Facebook, however, is PHP based and as a result, injects a good measure of component framework from the language.</p><p>It’s not hard to spend an entire day comparing React and Angular, the main point is that both have good developer avocation with strong community backing. Startups however, are leaning more towards React because they want the lowest form of overhead possible. Their survival depends on how quick they can go to market and pivot to demands and trends.</p><p>But what a lot of startups tend to miss is that with easier barrier to entry, the lower the potential quality. As more and more developers become self taught and community driven, certain topics such as programming paradigms and clean code get lost in the sea of beginners. That’s not to say that Angular developers are any better — but there is a certain enforced structure that Angular brings that React does not have.</p><p>Vue lives in its own little space and exists to solve the React vs Angular debate for those who don’t want to be part of the controversially biased towards a developer’s first encounter with the front end topic.</p><h3>What’s Netflix using?</h3><p>It turns out Netflix is using React — among a host of other backend and infrastructure technologies. If we actually look into the big picture of an entire application’s ecosystem, front end technologies only make up a small proportion of what is used.</p><p>PayPal uses Angular, as shown in the tell tale signs of <code>ng</code> here and there in the rendered HTML.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*6MdNOknb-FafAVA8f5KGEw.jpeg?q=20"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6MdNOknb-FafAVA8f5KGEw.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Screen capture from PayPal’s HTML.</figcaption></figure><p>Both Netflix and PayPal are equally gigantic in their own right and both are completely unrelated to Angular and React the way Google and Facebook are. Both have chosen React and Angular, respectively, as a solution for their front ends.</p><p>One could argue legacy code and whatever else, but both companies have more than enough money to hire an excess of developers to deal with their code base in the manner they want it to be dealt with.</p><p>On a side note, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/20/why-we-chose-vue/">GitLab uses Vue </a>and has been using it since 2016.</p><h3>It’s all about the solution, not the tools</h3><p>As the debate rages on what which framework or library is better than the other, no one seems to be asking the question — which is the best solution for what we’re trying to achieve?</p><p>If it’s speed of development on a tight budget then React is probably your best bet. If you want something meatier and much more robust due to the learning curve required, then Angular is the choice. Want the best of both worlds? Vue advocates will certainly put their hands up for this category.</p><p>Angular is not dying in popularity. Rather, the attention has just been diverted. While React might be eating up more of the development ecosystem and demand pie, Angular is still going steady despite React’s rising fame.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Y1oM7fyseJ81snTsX3AufA.jpeg?q=20"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Y1oM7fyseJ81snTsX3AufA.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Angular — Red. React — Blue. Google trends for worldwide search results for Angular and React over a 5 year period.</figcaption></figure><p>It is also worthy to note that Angular had to semi rebuild their community from scratch after it’s transformation from AngularJS. While they had a ready audience, everyone had to relearn everything when Angular 2 came out.</p><p>If we look at it this way, Angular as we know it today is actually younger than React by a good 3 years. The original Angular doesn’t really count because of how different it is from Angular 2+.</p><h3>Final words</h3><p>If you’re a new developer trying to figure out what to learn — don’t overthink it too much. At the end of the day it’s all just JavaScript so it might be better to actually learn how that works first before jumping into the ‘fun’ stuff and make things happen.</p><p>Whatever framework or library you end up with, you’re going to come into contact with transferable paradigms that makes it easier to pick up another framework or library. The key is to learn your first framework well and go beyond the proverbial ToDo list app.</p><p>Learn to be a developer that is well versed in programming paradigm and don’t get too hung up or attached to any one thing. Dig deep into architecture structures, designing and developing components, understanding how data flows through the application and state management, among other things.</p><p>Being able to recognize and transfer these skills is what separates those who get stuck in the junior and intermediate levels from the real seniors.</p></div></div>',

More often than not, applications that offer a service that revolves around location display a map on the screen to allow users a more interactive experience. To offer your own users the same experience in an iOS application developed in React Native, follow these steps!</p></div></div><div><div><h3>Step 1: Install Tools</h3><p>This tutorial will use the CocoaPods package manager for Xcode projects. To install CocoaPods, run:</p><p><code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code></p><h3>Step 2: Install Map Library</h3><p>In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run the following command:</p><p><code>npm install react-native-maps --save</code></p><p>This will allow you to make use of React Native maps, with support for Google Maps, if desired, in your application.</p><h3>Step 3: Create Podfile and Install Pods</h3><p>A Podfile allows you to easily list and install the different dependencies you’d like to utilize in your project, similar to a Gemfile in Ruby. Create a Podfile in the <code>ios/</code> folder of your React Native project and use the following sample to get you started:</p><figure></figure><p>Once your Podfile is created with the correct dependencies, replace <code>_YOUR_PROJECT_TARGET_</code> with your project name and head back to your terminal and navigate to the iOS directory of your project (where you had created your Podfile) and run the command<code>pod install</code>.</p><p>This command will install all pods and create a new <code>.xcworkspace</code> file that you can use to build your project in Xcode. Alternatively, kick off a build by moving back to your root directory and running<code>cd ..</code> to navigate back to your root directory and <code>react-native run-ios</code> to run your application.</p><h3>Step 4: Add Map</h3><p>Once your dependencies are all added, we are ready to add a map to your application! Add the following import statement to the top of the map component:</p><pre>import MapView from \'react-native-maps\';</pre><p>Add the following snippet to your render method to display a map with a fixed initial position:</p><figure></figure><p>You might notice that your map is nowhere to be found. This has to do with styling, so go ahead and add these static styles to be used in the view you are wrapping your container with:</p><figure></figure><p>These styles will set you up to incorporate the autocomplete component on the top of the screen. If it is not needed in your use case, feel free to stop here and simplify your style component to:</p><pre>const styles = StyleSheet.create({<br>  map: {<br>    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,<br>  },<br>});</pre><p>You might want to allow the displayed location to change. Maintaining map coordinates in state would allow you the flexibility of doing this:</p><figure></figure><p>After incorporating these bits and pieces, your component will look a lot like this:</p><figure></figure><p>Hopefully, your map loads successfully and navigates to an area in San Francisco!</p><h3>Step 5: Add Marker</h3><p>Markers allow users to visually pinpoint exactly where they are on the map. You may have noticed that our current map does not include such functionality, so let us go ahead and add one.</p><figure></figure><h3>Step 6: Install Places Autocomplete</h3><p>To allow users to interact more closely with the map, we want to use an autocomplete feature that takes an address and converts it to the coordinates needed to render the address on the map. Installing <code>react-native-google-places-autocomplete</code> will make this integration much easier.</p><p>To install, navigate back to your terminal and run in the root directory of your project: <code>npm install react-native-google-places-autocomplete --save</code>.</p><h3>Step 7: Add Autocomplete Component</h3><p>Now that we have React Native Places Autocomplete installed, let us add it to our map.</p><p>Add the following to your component:</p><figure></figure><p>Be sure to grab your <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key">Google Places API key</a> and add it to the <code>query</code> parameter of the component.</p><p>You will notice an input field at the top of your simulator screen — go ahead and begin typing an address and watch as suggestions will generate based on your input! The implementation above does not handle the address selection, but adding an onPress method would allow you to grab the selected address and pass it along as a parameter to the MapView rendering your map. This tweak will allow you to see the selected address rendered on the map.</p><p>That’s all it takes to incorporate Apple Maps into your application!</p></div></div></div>',

It was a brilliant, sunny day and the air buzzed with excitement.</p><p>On the back wall, I noticed a framed print that read:</p><blockquote>“We don’t sell boats. We sell time on the water.”</blockquote><p>Clever — and true. People <a href="http://resin%20paddle">don’t desire products</a>, they desire feelings that products give them.</p><figure></figure><p>Back at the rental shop, very few people care about hull design or reinforced resin paddles.</p><p>They want to soak up a summer afternoon. Spend time with people they love. Feel the warm breeze and stretch their desk-bound muscles.</p><p>Those two framed sentences stayed with me, and they reflect how I think about my company, <a href="https://www.jotform.com/">JotForm</a>:</p><blockquote>We don’t provide online forms. We make organizations more productive.</blockquote><p>It’s a deceptively small difference. After all, who cares about forms? I started the company 12 years ago, and <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/331-How-NOT-following-my-dreams-enabled-me-to-build-a-startup-with-3-2-million-users">even I’m not passionate about forms</a>.</p><p>What I <em>do</em> care about, though, is helping our 4.1 million customers to run smarter, more productive businesses.</p><p>We operate in a crowded industry, where even Google is gunning for our market share.</p><p>And our competitors are always pushing to “elevate” forms. They write edgy web copy about AI and conversations. Some even claim that forms are dead, while others try coining one fancy term after another.</p><p>That’s fine. They can focus on the cool factor.</p><p>But our customers just want to do business, and do it well.</p><p>How do we know? By asking — and listening closely.</p><p>Focusing on the customer (not the competition) <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/how-focusing-on-the-customer-not-the-competition-brought-us-over-1-million-new-signups-in-a-year/">brought us over 1 million new signups in 2017 alone</a>.</p><p>Across every industry, almost nothing will have a bigger impact on your business than listening to the people you serve.</p><p>When you listen to your customers, you can create new opportunities on your own terms, instead of fighting for space in a crowded ring.</p><p>And it starts with what you’re really offering:</p><figure></figure><h3>Define your true value</h3><p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d">2013 memo</a>,<a href="https://slack.com/"> Slack</a> CEO Stewart Butterfield outlined his vision for the product just two weeks before its preview release.</p><p>He reminded the team that they were selling organizational transformation, not software:</p><blockquote>What we are selling is not the software product — the set of all the features, in their specific implementation — because there are just not many buyers for this software product.</blockquote><blockquote>We’re selling a reduction in informational overload, relief from stress, and a new ability to extract the enormous value of hitherto useless corporate archives. We’re selling better organizations, better teams.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s why what we’re selling is organizational transformation.</blockquote><p>Five years later, Slack, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slack-fastest-growing-business-app">the fastest growing business app of all time</a>, has 8 million daily active users. Staying laser-focused on their true value has helped the company to achieve rapid growth and adoption.</p><p>And while Butterfield’s memo makes sense in hindsight, it can be surprisingly tough to uncover your distinctive value; your version of “time on the water.”</p><p>That’s because you’re too close to the product or service. You and your team are probably worried about micro-interactions and how the branding looks online.</p><p>Here’s where listening comes in.</p><figure></figure><h3>User research is your biggest weapon</h3><p>Even when you know what your product offers and what you’re truly selling, your customers might have a completely different idea. Let me explain.</p><p>Six months ago, our User Experience Research (UXR) team <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/tools-on-organizational-productivity/">presented some interesting research</a>. They had just completed a series of customer interviews with organizations from California to Singapore.</p><p>It was no surprise to see that users create forms for surveys, event registrations, online payments or email signups.</p><p>But our UXR team saw an unusual pattern. We used to think about forms as a way to collect data, but we discovered many customers were using the product to <em>act</em> on the data — to analyze and make sense of what it meant in their businesses.</p><p>These interviews reinforced that JotForm was a productivity tool; not just a way to make sign-up forms or payment sheets.</p><p>We could have high-fived each other and stopped there, but that’s not how we roll. And <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/350-How-we-develop-products-for-3-2M-users">customers wanted more</a>. They talked about using the data to make contracts and project proposals. Signed agreements and branded invitations.</p><p>If you listen, they’ll tell you. User research is your biggest weapon and it can easily amplify your business.</p><p>So, we decided it was time to revamp a feature that probably <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/dominating-tech-news/">won’t land us on the top of TechCrunch</a>, but it will save our customers time, money and frustration. We’ll reveal this feature next Monday, on October 15th.</p><h3>Go deeper, not wider</h3><h4>And don’t let success become a catalyst for failure</h4><p>Once you understand how your product functions in the market, it’s easy to get stuck. After all, you’ve found a fit. People want and need what you’re creating.</p><p>That’s when you have to listen even closer. You have to hear what people want, sometimes even before they’ve figured it out for themselves, and then deliver by going deeper — not reinventing your whole product.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382"><em>Essentialism</em></a> author Greg McKeown has spent nearly two decades studying what prevents capable people and organizations from reaching the next level. The surprising answer? Success.</p><p>When your product is doing well, that success naturally reveals fresh opportunities and directions that can diffuse your original focus. As McKeown explains in a <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/book/">short video</a>,</p><blockquote>“Success becomes a catalyst for failure, because it leads to what <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/five-stages-of-decline.html">Jim Collins</a> called ‘the undisciplined pursuit of more.’ The antidote to that problem is the disciplined pursuit of less, but better.”</blockquote><p>Now it’s time to narrow in on what matters most. If you’re struggling to find that focus, McKeown says you probably need more space and time.</p><p>Tune out the noise. Listen to yourself, and the people you’re working so hard to serve.</p><blockquote>“When people have the chance to think,” McKeown says, “they can easily discern between what’s essential and what’s not… We need to develop a routine that enables that space to think. In a world where we have so much information, we need more time to think and process it, not less.”</blockquote><p>This smart advice applies to customer research as well.</p><p>As more people request features, offer (sometimes contradictory) feedback, and contact support teams, you need to set aside additional time to listen to your users — to thoroughly understand how they use your product and what they’re trying to accomplish.</p><p>The more success you achieve, the more you need to formalize your listening with dedicated user research and interviewing processes.</p><p>I’ll write more soon about our user research approach, but here are some initial questions to help you get started.</p><figure></figure><h3>Five questions that can uncover new opportunities</h3><p>Talk to your customers as often as possible. Listen closely. If you’re not sure how to probe beyond basic use cases and find hidden needs, ask people:</p><blockquote>1. What do you often struggle to do or accomplish?</blockquote><blockquote>2. Where in your workflow do you or your team often hit roadblocks or frustrations?</blockquote><blockquote>3. Where in your processes do you stop using our product and switch to a different platform or service?</blockquote><blockquote>4. What would make your work life easier — on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis?</blockquote><blockquote>5. What would you like to spend less time doing, or what do you wish someone would do for you?</blockquote><p>Start by establishing your true value proposition. What needs and desires do you <em>actually</em> help people to fulfill?</p><p>That’s where you have the opportunity to become not just helpful, but truly essential.</p><p>Then, keep listening. Watch for even the “small” opportunities that keep popping up, and go deeper to help your customers experience, accomplish or learn even more.</p><p>Just like Slack, being customer-centric will help you to define a new market instead of battling it out in a large, well-defined space with clear incumbents.</p><p>Take JotForm. We could stay in the well-defined data collection market and compete with dozens of other online form builders. But we don’t.</p><p>Because, we don’t provide online forms. We make organizations more productive.</p><p>If you listen, they will tell you: focus on the customer, not the competition.</p></div></div></div></div>',

      html: '<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>T</span>his month, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has announced yet another new direction for his famously bad-acting company. Now, he says, the platform once responsible for the Cambridge Analytica election fiasco and countless other personal invasions will become the poster child for privacy and encryption. Maybe after all the evasions, missteps, and pivots, Zuckerberg is finally learning from his experiences.</p><p>But as I watch Mark Zuckerberg zig and zag his way through one disaster after another, I can’t help but muse on one of the ways he could have spared himself — and the rest of humanity — all this trouble. What if he had simply stayed in school?</p><p>At the end of his sophomore year, Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard’s class of 2006 in order to pursue development of Facebook. The social networking platform was already the 10th most trafficked site on the internet, so young Zuck decided to follow in the footsteps of Harvard dropout Bill Gates and pursue Silicon Valley venture capitalists over Cambridge academics.</p><p>After all, at least by the logic of lean startups, Harvard had already served its purpose. Young Zuck had gained enough programming chops in computer science to build his minimum viable product, and — perhaps more important — he had leveraged the elite student population of Harvard to find the partners and ideas he needed to get a company up and running.</p><p>But by forgoing a college education, Zuckerberg may have denied himself — and the world — the benefit of some historical, cultural, economic, and political context for his work. And we are all now paying the price for his impatience. What if Mark Zuckerberg had decided to stay in school instead? Looking back through <a href="https://library.harvard.edu/collections/archived-harvard-university-online-course-catalogs">Harvard’s course catalogs for 2005 and 2006</a>, one finds a bounty of offerings, from sociology and psychology to philosophy and literature, that would have challenged the assumptions underlying Silicon Valley dogma and might just have given Zuckerberg the insight he needed to build a platform that promoted human cognition and connection, and even democracy itself, instead of undermining them.</p><p>For example, over his four semesters as an upperclassman, Zuckerberg could have availed himself of Harvard professors, including <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/mankiw/home">Greg Manciw</a>, former chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers. If Zuck had taken Manciw’s “Principles of Economics” class, he may have recognized that there is a growth-based economic operating system running beneath every Silicon Valley unicorn — one that ultimately demands turning users into products or, worse, data fodder for the algorithms. He may have realized that taking the most investment at the highest valuation would only put his company at the mercy of its shareholders and obligate him to grow by any means necessary.</p><p>Or what if he had chosen to study with superstar literary critic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Vendler">Helen Vendler</a>, whose undergraduate course “Literature and the Arts” offered “a study of poetry as the history and science of feeling”? Might Zuckerberg have later been able to predict his platform’s bias for emotional insensitivity, or could he have curtailed the use of language as cognitive weapon?</p><p>Maybe that inquiry would have been even better informed by taking <a href="https://stevenpinker.com/">Steven Pinker</a>’s course that spring, “The Human Mind,” which covered psychoanalysis, behavioralism, cognitive neuroscience, and evolutionary psychology. Imagine if Zuckerberg had considered human consciousness in an academic or ethical context before setting upon entraining the collective psyche through his news feed algorithms?</p><p>He could have also learned about demographic change and social stratification — the very impulse for nationalism — by attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niall_Ferguson">Niall Ferguson</a>’s history course. He could have taken “The Harlem Renaissance” with <a href="https://aaas.fas.harvard.edu/people/henry-louis-gates-jr">Henry Louis Gates Jr.</a> and learned how a neighborhood of real people interacting in real space differs from an online, data-determined affinity group. Or what if he had chosen to study under Pulitzer Prize–winning historian <a href="https://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/laurel-thatcher-ulrich">Laurel Thatcher Ulrich</a>, whose courses meant to “show the interconnections between public events and private experience”? Maybe learning about the delicate interplay between people’s interior and public worlds would have led Zuckerberg to think twice about offering up his users’ brain stems to the highest political bidder.</p><p>Yes, Zuckerberg has apologized profusely after the fact for helping to drive American democracy off a cliff. “We didn’t take a broad-enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/09/zuckerberg-testimony-congress-471310">he told Congress</a>. But what if he had chosen to study the elements of working democracy before reengineering it on all of our behalf? Facebook wants for some good lessons in history, economics, sociology, psychology, governance, and ethics.</p><p>When Mark chose to drop out of school, he was barely 20 years old. His own brain wasn’t even completely formed yet. The myelin sheaths hadn’t fully developed around the cells of his neocortex, offering the sort of impulse control and executive functioning required to make decisions of this magnitude. Instead of continuing to develop his mind with educators profoundly dedicated to that purpose, he transferred parental authority onto the likes of Napster founder Sean Parker and big-data billionaire Peter “Palantir” Thiel. With mentors like these, it’s no wonder Zuck turned Facebook into the poster child for a surveillance economy.</p><p>As if to create more such intellectually and emotionally challenged founders, Thiel is paying more future Zuckerbergs to drop out of school, with <a href="https://thielfellowship.org/faq/">a fellowship</a> that “gives $100,000 to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom.” Why learn if you can build?</p><p>Yet this only makes sense when we think of education in its most utilitarian context — as if the point of school is to become a more productive worker, get a good job, or offer a startup to a billionaire. Since when do we understand school as training for work? If anything, <a href="https://medium.com/s/douglas-rushkoff/their-ridicule-means-we-are-winning-e2cd5f27bf12">as I’ve explained before</a>, it was meant as compensation for a life of work. Even the coal miner, it was thought, should enjoy the dignity of being able to return home after a day in the mines and appreciate a good novel or be able to vote intelligently.</p><p>Today, however, concerned principals and college presidents regularly meet with corporate CEOs to find out what sorts of skills they’ll need from the worker of tomorrow. JavaScript or Python? Excel or blockchain? School becomes, at best, a way for corporations to externalize the cost of job training to the public sector and, at worst, a form of social control.</p><p>Zuckerberg got the message: Program or be programmed. And he went right along with it, understanding his human users purely in terms of our utility value. We are not human beings with essential dignity, but data to be mined, inventory to be tagged, and nervous systems to be triggered.</p><p>Real education subverts this dynamic. School is a means of promoting not social control, or even productivity, but the higher value of learning itself. School is less valuable for the information or skills transmitted than the mimesis — the live mirroring and modeling — through which students learn to think critically, develop rapport, and establish solidarity. School is not directed at our utilitarian value, but our essential, intrinsic dignity. How profoundly sad it is that many of us think of a Harvard education more as a professional credential than a pinnacle of humanism.</p><p>If Mark Zuckerberg had valued his own human development over his compatibility with Silicon Valley and its investors, he may not have stumbled so easily into the ethical nightmare that is Facebook today.</p><p>Admittedly, had Zuckerberg finished out his college career, Facebook may have come out two whole years later. But, oh, what a difference those two years might have made.</p></div></div><div><p><em>Douglas Rushkoff is the author of the new book </em><a href="http://rushkoff.com/teamhuman">Team Human</a><em>.</em></p></div></div>',

      html: '<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The technology industry has, at least, for the past forty years, been something of a sausage-fest, with men dominating almost all tiers of the workplace. A new report from infosec industry group, the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/">(ISC)2</a>, shows that’s gradually changing. Not only are women representing a larger swathe of the cybersecurity workforce, they’re also accomplishing great things in leadership roles.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.isc2.org/research/women-in-cybersecurity">(ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study</a> shows that women comprise an estimated 24 percent of the cybersecurity workforce. While that’s far from an even (and ideal) 50-50 split, it’s certainly indicative of an upwards trend of more women joining the industry. For context, in 2017, women made up just 11 percent of the burgeoning cybersecurity sphere.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this study, while promising, has significantly changed the parameters of who is included in the sample by widening the professions eligible for inclusion. Previously, the group consisted solely of infosec professionals working in official cybersecurity professions. In the latest edition, the survey sample includes other IT/ICT workers who dedicate at least a quarter of their working time on cybersecurity-related responsibilities, even if it’s not their main job.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that the methodology for the latest iteration of the study has generated some discussion, highlighting the difficulty of pinning down the true figure of women in infosec. If anything can be gleaned from this report, it’s that women have been doing infosec for a lot longer, and a lot more often, than has been previously recognized.</p><h2>What is an infosec worker?</h2><p>Not everyone in infosec is necessarily a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">penetration tester</a>, and not everyone in infosec spends all their time sat dealing with security-related problems. It’s worth recognizing that this is a field that’s fundamentally multidisciplinary in nature, and people often wear multiple hats (all white, one hopes) while working in the same role.</p><p>You could be an instructor who trains office workers how to perform their jobs without exposing the business to any unnecessary security risks (like, for example, using random USB flash drives that you found on the street). Programmers could spend their time reviewing code in order to find security vulnerabilities before a potential adversary does. You could be a journalist working on a security beat, writing important analysis about industry trends.</p><p>When I mentioned I was working on this post, someone (quite rightfully) pointed out that the involvement of women in infosec is nothing new. Women have historically had an enlarged role when it comes to keeping and protecting business information, working in fields like archiving and library science. And that, it could be argued, isn’t too far removed from today’s digital roles.</p><p>The report also shows that women are increasingly taking up a leadership role in the infosec industry. According to the (ISC)2, some 28 percent of women who responded to the survey hold a C-level or executive role. In comparison, only 19 percent of men said the same.</p><p>Similarly, seven percent of female respondents hold the coveted Chief Technology Officer position, compared to just two percent of men. A further 18 percent of women have a job title of IT director, compared to 14 percent of men.</p><p>So, in short: there’s more women in information security. Not only that, but they’re climbing the highest echelons of the industry and attaining leadership roles. Of course, there’s a long way to go, but overall, this is extremely good news. You can find out more about the (ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study <a href="https://www.isc2.org/research/women-in-cybersecurity">here</a>.</p><h2>Meet the experts</h2><p>Of course, I don’t want to merely tell you about these accomplished women. I want you to follow them and see their accomplishments first-hand. While writing this piece, I reached out to my Twitter followers and asked what women in infosec they admired. The response overwhelming. Dozens of people got in touch, to the point where Twitter said (paraphrased): “<em>I see you’re getting a shitload of notifications. Want to set up some filters?</em>”</p><p>Obviously, this isn’t an exhaustive list. Not even close. There are hundreds of thousands of people working in infosec. It’d be impossible to highlight all the wonderful and talented women in this sphere. Consider this list, albeit embarassingly small, a solid starting place.</p><p>It’s also indicative of what the report tries to argue, insofar as you don’t have to be a pentester in order to be considered an infosec professional. Information security is a multidisciplinary field, with countless avenues of entry. Below, you’ll find developers, analysts, authors, educators, and much more.</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/hacks4pancakes">Lesley Carhart, Principal Threat Hunder at Dragos Inc</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/KeirstenBrager">Keirsten Brager, ICS Security Engineer</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/Swati_THN">Swati Khandelwal, Cybersecurity reporter at The Hacker News</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/KateOflaherty">Kate O’Flaherty, freelance security journalist</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/malwareunicorn">Amanda Rousseau (AKA MalwareUnicorn), Offensive Security Researcher at Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/Jenny_Radcliffe">Jenny Radcliffe, social engineering expert</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/aloria">Kelly Lum, Appsec at Spotify and NYU professor</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/k8em0">Katie Moussouris, Founder and CEO at Luta Security</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/wendynather">Wendy Nather, Head of Advisory CISOs at Duo Security</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/evacide">Eva Galperin, Director of Cybersecurity at the EFF</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/InfoSecSherpa">Tracy Z.

There are two main factors at play: “Disinformation spreads like wildfire in social media,” she adds, “and when it comes to news reporting, sometimes it is more important for journalists to be fast than accurate.”</p><p>Which is why it’s useful to know how to evaluate news the way a scientist does. Scientists labor under a burden of proof. They must conduct experiments and collect data under controlled conditions to arrive at their conclusions — and be ready to defend their findings with facts, not emotions.</p><p>“We all have gut feelings and biases that sometimes cloud our judgment,” says Frans. But scientific thinking offers us tools for “evaluating information in a rational way.”</p><p>Try these 6 tips to read the news like a scientist:</p><h2><b>1. Cultivate your skepticism.</b></h2><p>Science moves forward by challenging accepted wisdom. You can do the same. When you learn a new piece of information through social media, think to yourself: “This may be true, but it also may be false,” Frans says. “This kind of healthy skepticism does not mean you’re dismissing everything as false — it simply means remembering the things you hear <i>could</i> be false, but they could also be true … or they could be something in between.”</p><h2><b>2. Find out who is making the claim.</b></h2><p>“In science, researchers have to declare potential conflicts of interest before publishing their findings,” says Frans. When you encounter a new claim, look for conflicts of interest. Ask: Do they stand to profit from what they say? Are they affiliated with an organization that could be swaying them? Two other questions to consider: What makes the writer or speaker qualified to comment on the topic? What statements have they made in the past?</p><h2><b>3. Watch out for the halo effect.</b></h2><p>The halo effect, says Frans, “is a cognitive bias that makes our feeling towards someone affect how we judge their claims. If we dislike someone, we are a lot more likely to disagree with them; if we like them, we are biased to agree.” It’s such a common human trait that the scientific community has devised a workaround: New scientific papers under review are read “blind,” with the authors’ names removed. That way, the experts who are deciding whether it’s worthy of publication don’t know which of their fellow scientists wrote it so they’ll be able to react free from pre-judgement or bias. You can try this with your own news feed, too. Maybe you’ve read about a jobs policy proposed by the candidate you favor, and you think it sounds good. Frans suggests, “Simply question how you would consider the claim if it came from someone else.”</p><h2><b>4. Look at the evidence.</b></h2><p>When evaluating a claim, Frans asks, “Can the sources be traced? Are they reliable? Is the conclusion based on a rational evaluation of the information?” And you should try to consider <i>all</i> of the research on a topic. She says, “For instance, if there is one study claiming that drinking wine is just as good for your health as going to the gym, this finding is not relevant if ninety-nine studies show the opposite.” Before you act on or share a particularly surprising or enraging story, do a quick Google search — you might learn something even more interesting.</p><h2><b>5. Beware of the tendency to cherry-pick information.</b></h2><p>Another human bias — confirmation bias — means we’re more likely to notice stories or facts that fit what we already believe (or want to believe). As Frans says, “When you search for information, you should not disregard the information that goes against whatever opinion you might have in advance.” Some scientists combat this by seeking out collaborators who, as management thinker <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/margaret_heffernan_dare_to_disagree/transcript?language=en">Margaret Heffernan</a> puts it, “aren’t echo chambers.” These are people who will actively try to prove you wrong and can help you check your ideas and assumptions. In your own life, look for friends and acquaintances on social media with alternative viewpoints. You don’t have to agree with them, or tolerate misinformation from them — but it’s healthy and balanced to have some variety in your information diet.</p><h2><b>6. Recognize the difference between correlation and causation.</b></h2><p>Frans researches ADHD and autism, and, she notes, in recent decades, “the number of individuals diagnosed with these disorders have increased rapidly.” Many possible causes have been raised, including vaccinations, video games and junk food. However, she says, “there is no evidence supporting these claims, and it’s important to remember that just because two things increase simultaneously, this does not mean that they are causally linked to each other. Correlation does not equal causality.” Keep this in mind when thinking about our world. For example, if there is a rise in violent crime in your area and it’s being blamed on gang activity, or if a politician is credited with creating a low unemployment rate, take a wider view and look into the other contributing factors. Frans says, “It’s important to remember that there might be alternative explanations to a phenomenon.”</p><p><i>Watch her <a href="https://tedxstockholm.com/">TEDxStockholm</a> talk here:</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/how-to-be-a-better-human/">how to be a better human</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/news-literacy/">news literacy</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/science-2/">science</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/scientists/">scientists</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/sweden/">sweden</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/tedx/">TEDx</a></li></ul></div></div>',

      html: '<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><img></div><div id="9-215687"><div><div><div><p>Deep technologies—novel technologies that offer significant advances over those currently in use—are attracting an unprecedented amount of interest and activity. The aggregate global private investment in seven deep tech categories researched by BCG and Hello Tomorrow soared by more than 20% a year from 2015 through 2018 to reach almost $18 billion.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="9-216028-0"><div><div><p>Deep tech is no longer the primary purview of deep pockets—or of the scientific community. A number of trends have brought us to a point of major change in how deep tech research is pursued and how new technologies are brought to market. Innovation is a much more fragmented and diverse endeavor than ever before—geographically, functionally, and industrially. Some suggest that we are at the beginning of a new cycle that could carry R&amp;D for the next two to three generations or that we may be shifting from the end of one cycle, a “deployment” phase—which has been mostly about building applications that are based on existing information and communications technologies—to the beginning of an “installation” phase in which new technology infrastructures are constructed. Clearly, a new deep tech ecosystem is taking shape, with big ramifications for all players, most notably companies, investors, and startups.</p></div></div></div><div id="9-219032-1"><div><div><p>Two previous publications by BCG and Hello Tomorrow examined the business prospects for emerging technologies. (See “<a href="/publications/2017/technology-digital-joint-ventures-alliances-what-deep-tech-startups-corporate-partners.aspx">What Deep-Tech Startups Want from Corporate Partners</a>” and “<a href="/publications/2017/digital-joint-venture-alliances-framework-deep-tech-collaboration.aspx">A Framework for Deep-Tech Collaboration</a>,” articles by BCG and Hello Tomorrow, April 2017.) In the past year, BCG and Hello Tomorrow researched seven fields of deep tech endeavor and the roles of multiple types of deep tech ecosystem participants to gain a better understanding of how companies are conducting R&amp;D in emergent technologies today. The seven fields—advanced materials, artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, blockchain, drones and robotics, photonics and electronics, and quantum computing—constitute the most active and promising deep technologies and span the spectrum from very early research to market applications in full development. They therefore provide a representative picture of the deep tech landscape.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-2"><div><div><div><p>We relied on in-depth interviews, market research, examinations of funding, patent and publication data, and exclusive data from more than 2,000 deep tech startups. The resulting report, <a href="https://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-The-Dawn-of-the-Deep-Tech-Ecosystem-Mar-2019.pdf"><em>The Dawn of the Deep Tech Ecosystem</em></a>, tours the evolving ecosystem and offers observations on how the different types of participants can maximize the value of their engagement. It examines how corporations, investors, and startups active in deep tech need to think about their roles in the future. This article presents a summary of our findings and conclusions.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-3"><div><div><div><h2>Defining Deep Tech</h2><p>Three attributes in particular characterize deep tech in a business context. These technologies can have a big impact, take a long time to reach market-ready maturity, and require a significant amount of capital to develop and scale.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-4"><div><div><div><h3>Impact</h3><p>Innovations based on deep tech can generate enormous economic value, but their ultimate impact extends far beyond the financial realm to everyday life. Hello Tomorrow’s analysis of the 1,646 startups that qualified for its current annual Global Challenge, a startup competition that assesses deep tech startups on four criteria—technological innovation, business model, team skills, and expected impact—shows that these companies anticipate having an impact on a wide variety of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs). The goal receiving the most attention is good health and well-being (51% of startups), followed by those related to industry, innovation, and infrastructure (50%) and mitigating human impact on the environment (sustainable cities and communities—28%, responsible consumption and production—25%, climate action—22%, affordable and clean energy—18%, and clean water and sanitation—10%).</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-5"><div><div><div><h3>Time and Scale</h3><p>Deep tech takes time to move from basic science to a technology that can be applied to actual use cases. (Indeed, the incorporation of a startup is not the beginning of the story but a milestone in the development of a technology, when the science has been proven and the work starts to target a particular market.) The amount of time varies substantially by technology, though it is almost always longer than the time needed to develop an innovation based on a widely available technology (think of a new mobile application). Analysis of the startups in the Hello Tomorrow Challenge shows that it takes 4 years on average to develop a technology in biotech (1.8 years from incorporation to first prototype and another 2.2 years to reach the market), while the comparable figure is only 2.4 years for a startup in blockchain (1.4 years to first prototype and 1 year to market). The wild card is the technology itself, as each advance seems to speed the next.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-6"><div><div><div><h3>Investment</h3><p>The funding needs of deep tech companies vary significantly with the technology. For example, data from Hello Tomorrow’s Challenge participants shows that developing the first prototype in biotech costs an average of almost $1.3 million, but in blockchain, it costs only about $200,000. Several factors complicate tech investment. One is market risk. Many companies are seeking funding in the early research phase, long before they can put a product or even prototype in the hands of potential customers, meaning that investors have few if any KPIs with which they can evaluate traction and market potential. Another complicating factor is technology risk; many investors don’t have the specific expertise in-house that they need to accurately assess the potential of emerging technologies.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-7"><div><div><div><p>As a consequence, deep tech startups rarely follow the established funding progression of other types of young tech enterprises—seeking money from friends and family, then angel or seed investors, then successive rounds of venture capital investment at increasing valuations (which validate the decisions of previous investors), leading ultimately to a trade sale or an IPO. In deep tech, public funding plays an important role in the early phase, and friends-and-family money is rarely significant relative to the substantial capital requirements of early R&amp;D. Private-public financing schemes are becoming increasingly important to financing deep tech ventures along their entire life cycle, and corporate venture capital (CVC) funds, incubators, and accelerators also have become prevalent partners since they provide not only funding but other critical forms of support.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-8"><div><div><div><h2>What’s Driving Deep Tech?</h2><p>There have always been aggressive and visionary scientists and entrepreneurs. What’s changed is the ability of these individuals to access technological capabilities, financing, and other critical resources to bring their dreams into the real-life lab and perhaps to market. The growing deep tech ecosystem facilitates research into almost any kind of technology, from things we can’t see to concepts that relatively few can explain. This ecosystem is rooted in a handful of trends.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-9"><div><div><div><h3>The Rise of New Platform Technologies</h3><p>Innovation in the past few decades has been driven mainly by a few powerful platform technologies (silicon chips, desktop computers, the internet, and mobile technologies) that led to a wide variety of applications in many industries. Powerful new platform technologies are now emerging, paving the way for innovation in the next several decades. It’s happening simultaneously in software (machine learning), hardware (quantum computing), and biology (genetic sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9, which are reenergizing biotech). Their convergence multiplies their potential and creates the kind of momentum that drives new industrial revolutions.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-10"><div><div><div><h3>Falling Barriers</h3><p>As new platform technologies rise, barriers fall. Today’s innovators have a wealth of technological capability at their fingertips. PCs are inexpensive and powerful, and even more powerful computing hardware is on offer from cloud-based services. Easy access to hardware obviates big upfront capital expenditures for tech. Likewise, software is both open-source and widely available as a service. Computer-aided design and manufacturing and 3D printing have revolutionized prototyping. In biotechnology, sequencing and synthesizing DNA have become standard services.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-11"><div><div><div><h3>More Fragmentation and Diverse Approaches for Business</h3><p>Innovation today is a much more fragmented and varied endeavor than ever before. More young companies in more places are pursuing more new avenues of invention, and many of these involve advances in new technologies. Our research into seven deep technologies found an enormous breadth of activity. In AI, for example, we counted more than 1,300 companies in 48 countries and 401 cities. (See Exhibit 1.)</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-12"><div><div><div><div><p>At the same time, big corporations are diversifying their innovation programs, using CVC, incubators, and other venturing tools to gain access to new technologies. Research for this report shows that the number of private venture investments with CVC participation increased from 161 deals in 2015 to 203 in 2018, and the total value of private venture investments with CVC participation increased from approximately $3.2 billion in 2015 to $5.7 billion in 2018. In addition to their use of CVC, more and more large companies are deploying a variety of innovation investment and development vehicles, matching the tool to the circumstances (such as time to market) and their objectives (such as assessing new or disruptive technologies, improving existing technologies, or gaining control of a new technology).</p><p>One result of this fragmentation and diversity of effort is that knowledge, skills, and information, while much more accessible, are also harder to harness because they reside in more, and more disparate, places—geographically, industrially, and functionally. This disparity is driving the need for new models of collaboration in basic R&amp;D.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="section-13"><div><div><div><h3>Growth in Available Capital</h3><div><p>There has been no shortage of venture capital in recent years. According to Crunchbase, global venture deal value approached $100 billion in the third quarter of 2018, up more than 40% over 2017. Deal volume also rose 40% during this period, coming close to 10,000 rounds.</p><p>The capacity for startups to achieve new scientific and commercial levels of success has encouraged investors to infuse hundreds of billions of dollars into small companies. Our research shows plenty of funding activity for deep tech companies. (See Exhibit 2.) Both deep tech startups and more mature companies have attracted a greater amount of funding than other types of tech companies in the past five years. Deep tech companies have also completed more funding rounds.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="section-14"><div><div><div><p>Some of the ready availability of capital must be credited to the macroeconomic conditions, however—most significantly, the unprecedented period of low (or no) interest rates following the 2008 financial crisis, which appears to be coming to an end. In addition, many believe that the already high, and still rising, valuations of many tech unicorns cannot be sustained. Venture funding, like other types of capital, runs in cycles, and we should not be surprised to see a pullback in the coming years.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-15"><div><div><div><h3>A Shifting Role for Governments</h3><p>Governments around the world have undergone shifting roles in new technology R&amp;D support, with the two biggest players, the US and China, moving in opposite directions. In the US, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, federal spending on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP dropped from more than 1.2% in 1976 to about 0.7% in 2018. In contrast, China is on an R&amp;D tear. According to data compiled by the <em>Economist</em>, China’s spending on R&amp;D on a purchasing-power-parity basis has risen about 400% over the past two decades to exceed $400 billion a year and compete with that of Europe and the US. UNESCO data shows that total spending on R&amp;D in the US is equal to 2.7% of GDP, followed by China at 2.1% and the EU at 2.0%.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-16"><div><div><div><h3>Deep Problems Call for Deep Technologies</h3><p>The scientists and entrepreneurs working in deep tech are not put off by big problems—or the time and effort it takes to solve them. Indeed, for many, these problems are part of the attraction. Mitigating climate change, feeding 8 billion people, and keeping an aging population healthy are challenges that seem worth dedicating a career to—and also big markets that attract a lot of attention from startups, investors, and corporations alike.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-17"><div><div><div><h2>It Takes an Ecosystem</h2><div><p>From R&amp;D to industrialization and commercialization, deep tech today encompasses a broad ecosystem that includes multiple types of participants, each of which is active in one or more smaller ecosystems that is organized around a particular field of research, technology, industry, or mission. Business ecosystems are not new, of course, but deep tech ecosystems are nascent and operate in emerging—and therefore not yet stabilized—technologies and industries. As a consequence, they are a different breed and can be hard for traditional companies to navigate. Deep technologies also can affect entire value or supply chains and therefore require a more thorough analysis of the stakeholders’ interdependencies and value creation models in order to determine how to align goals, set strategies, and organize for interaction with others. Newcomers can find themselves in unfamiliar territory, and carving out a role can be complex, but they need to find their way.</p><p>Deep tech ecosystems have a set of characteristics that differentiate them from other business collaborations or partnerships. For one thing, they involve more types of players from more diverse sources in both the public and the private sectors, each of which has its own needs and priorities and makes its own contributions. (See Exhibit 3.)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="section-18"><div><div><div><p>In many ways, startups sit at the center of deep tech ecosystems because they play an important role in speeding the research, development, and commercialization of the new technology or product and sometimes leading radical innovation that is too risky for incumbents. They are assisted in their efforts by a variety of other actors, with some playing multiple roles. Investors, for example, provide funding but often also offer expertise in corporate development and go-to-market strategies as well as high-level contacts. Likewise, corporate partners provide funding and a host of other necessities, not least of which is access to markets and potential customers. Universities can be important research partners, and facilitators (such as accelerators) frequently play a key role in helping startups develop other necessary relationships.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="9-216029-19"><div><div><p>Deep tech ecosystems are highly dynamic—players come and go, and they create new kinds of relationships that are not always formal, defined by contracts, or well set. As the emerging technology or industry grows and matures, so do the relationships between the ecosystem’s stakeholders. Compared with early-stage startups, for example, mature startups in the commercialization phase need less technical, IP, and regulatory expertise and more visibility and access to the market. The attractiveness of various types of partners also shifts because startups turn to different stakeholders over time in order to gain access to needed resources. For example, the percentage of qualified startups in the 2018 Hello Tomorrow Challenge that are looking to corporate partners for help with product development drops from 38% to 24% between the experimental and the commercialization stages, while the percentage seeking assistance with product distribution rises from 24% to 47%.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-20"><div><div><div><div><p>In addition, deep tech collaborations rely less on a central orchestrator and more on multifaceted interactions among participants. Even when an ecosystem has a strong player at the center (generally the one that brought the other parties together), rarely is any entity in complete control. The orchestrator’s role is more that of magnet than managing partner. Each partner can influence the direction of the whole, and alliances among participants can also shift the balance of power over key strategic questions. Ecosystem management can be as much an exercise in diplomacy and negotiation as business strategy and direction.</p><p>And, while money is one important currency, it is far from the only means of exchange among participants. Knowledge, data, skills, expertise, contacts, and market access are also currencies that link ecosystem players. This means that traditional financial measures, such as revenues and profits, are not always the best means for assessing value realized. Deep tech ecosystems often involve relationships that are built around nontraditional, indirect, or nonfinancial linkages (involving data or services, for example) that push corporations, startups, investors, and others to develop new models for collaboration and remuneration. Ecosystem participants trade in a variety of currencies at the same time.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="section-21"><div><div><div><h2>The Rules of Win-Win in Deep Tech Ecosystems</h2><p>How each participant approaches the ecosystem affects its ability to achieve value as well as influence others and the whole. Companies, investors, startups, and others should be guided strategically by three questions about themselves and their goals.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-22"><div><div><div><h3>What Do We Bring to the Ecosystem?</h3><p>Since ecosystems operate on a win-win model, each participant needs to think about not only its own goals but the goals of the whole and how it can help the ecosystem advance a particular technology or market. The answer may be money, data, expertise, market access, or some other attribute. All participants need to contribute their currency, and make the ecosystem stronger, before they can realize their individual gains through commercial applications.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-23"><div><div><div><h3>What Do We Want from the Ecosystem?</h3><p>All participants should be clear on why they are engaging with the deep tech ecosystem and what they hope to achieve. One answer for many, of course, is ROI, but the goals—and their associated timeframes—should be detailed with as much specificity as possible. Participants need to assess the value realized from all dimensions, not only financial ones. Since the monetization of technology in its early stages can be difficult to predict, participants also need to build use cases and assess their potential long-term value before developing business models.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-24"><div><div><div><h3>How Do We Interact with Others to Achieve Our Goals?</h3><div><p>Two characteristics of ecosystems require a rethinking of textbook management techniques, especially for more traditional participants.</p><p>First, ecosystems are collaborative—they grow and strengthen through the continual interaction of all stakeholders toward a common end—and therefore the need for collaboration can trump more traditional competitive considerations. An automotive and an aerospace company might work with a startup on the development of next-generation batteries but so might two automakers, the startup, and a government agency because they all want the technology to come to market. Networks play an important role in collaboration because they foster the exchange of different ecosystem currencies.</p><p>Second, deep tech ecosystems’ endgame and path of progress are highly uncertain. Any given idea, startup—or emergent technology—may or may not succeed. Traditional top-down strategy and R&amp;D project management techniques need to be reinforced by methodologies designed to manage uncertainty. Different management approaches can provoke, foster, and increase the odds of the desired result, but they cannot engineer it. In such an environment, companies and investors should not think in terms of a single “bet” or “bets.” They need to engage with and nurture the entire ecosystem and look for the winning startups or technology to emerge from it.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="9-216037"><div><div><div><div><p>Finally, all participants can learn from failures. It is in the very nature of deep tech that many ventures will not succeed. But they will almost always impart lessons that can inform the next initiative or collaboration.</p><br><hr><p>We are in the early days of the new deep tech ecosystem paradigm. Players, roles, and rules will all evolve as new discoveries are made and technologies demonstrate their potential. Perhaps the first rule for all would-be stakeholders is to set their goals and get into the game. Only then can they really learn—including from failures—and tap into the power and potential of the win-win ecosystem.</p></div><p><a href="http://image-src.bcg.com/Images/BCG-The-Dawn-of-the-Deep-Tech-Ecosystem-Mar-2019-R-2_tcm9-216221.pdf">Download the full report</a></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><img></div><div><p><span>Arnaud</span> <span>de la Tour</span></p><p>Cofounder &amp; CEO, Hello Tomorrow</p><p>Paris</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>',

On January 7, 2016, a poster sought advice on the shipment of unsanctioned contraband. “…the company refuses to sell it here,” wrote Reddit user orochiman. “Just wondering if the feds will come shoot my dog if I order it from Europe.” The substance in question? Toothpaste.</p><p>Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin has established a cult following among those seeking to treat tooth sensitivity. Alex*, a 45-year-old who works in IT in France, says he discovered the toothpaste in 2012 while living in Romania. (*Alex requested anonymity for this article<em>, </em>as did several other Reddit users contacted for this story.)</p><p>“I was having a lot of trouble with cracks and holes in my tooth enamel and the dentists were saying the only solution is crowning a lot of my teeth,” Alex said over Reddit direct message. After using this toothpaste, he said, “I was a new man. Not only did my teeth stop hurting but the enamel damage seemed to be repaired. The NovaMin was filling in the cracks.” Alex said he’s “basically addicted” to the toothpaste, as the cracks return after a week without the product.</p><p>In a NovaMin-inspired Twitter thread, <em>PC Magazine</em> senior features writer Chandra Steele praised the toothpaste, saying that the product was “endorsed by my teeth after having used it for a month. (They look fabulous.)” Glowing reviews pop-up across the internet: from subreddits r/Dentistry and /r/LifeProTips, to mentions on <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-do-dentists-think-of-calcium-sodium-phosphosilicate-NovaMin%C2%AE-as-a-remineralizer-in-toothpaste">Quora</a>, Y Combinator’s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13365369">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/UntoIdSecrets/status/1023272471871381504">Twitter</a>, and specialized sites like <a href="http://www.dentalhypotheses.com/article.asp?issn=2155-8213;year=2017;volume=8;issue=4;spage=104;epage=109;aulast=Shah">dentalhypotheses.com</a> and <a href="http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/gsk-drops-ball-with-puzzling-us-release-of-sensodyne-repair-protect-sans-45s5-glass">Ceramics.org</a>. On Amazon, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C0BMQV4LM7ZI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B06XK6XJBP">reviewer</a> called it the “best toothpaste ever” and the few negative reviews tend to focus on the size of the packaging — there’s not enough of the stuff! — or complaints about counterfeits. When YouTube celebrity Casey Neistat asked his followers if he had anything to worry about from too much seltzer water consumption, Leo, a user who requested anonymity for this piece, <a href="https://twitter.com/krispuckett/status/962560814174490624">recommended NovaMin</a>. Leo told <em>Elemental </em>he keeps a cache of the product on hand.</p><p>“Usually when my wife or myself travel, we’ll pick up a few tubes.” he said. Leo says his dentist says his teeth look fantastic.</p><p>But for consumers in the United States, the hyped product is often accompanied by a crucial caveat: Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin is not available for sale there, meaning that customers have to pay as much as $10 for a 75ml tube to be shipped from overseas.</p><p>So is Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin as radically good as its fans think it is? And if so, why isn’t it being sold in the U.S.?</p><p>To understand what Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin does, you first have to understand teeth. The outer layer of our teeth contain dentinal tubules, or tiny canals — up to 50,000 per square millimeter. These canals travel from the outside of the tooth to the inner “pulp,” where the nerves are located. When dentinal fluid is pushed through these canals by pressure, hot and cold liquids, or food, it can trigger the nerves and cause pain, according to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927677/">hydrodynamic theory</a> on dentinal hypersensitivity.</p><p>That’s where a material called bioactive glass — the supposedly revolutionary material underlying NovaMin — comes in. Bioactive glass, or bioglass, was developed by the late Larry Hench, a Department of Defense contractor. According to his 2006 article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10856-006-0432-z">The Story of Bioglass</a>” in the <em>Journal of Materials Science, </em>Hench was attempting “something new, to discover a material that would not form an interfacial layer of scar tissue but instead would form a living bond with the host tissues.” Hench turned to vanadium phosphate glasses, a material used in semiconductors.</p><p><a href="http://profiles.ucsf.edu/grayson.marshall">Dr. Grayson Marshall</a>, a dentist in the Division of Biomaterials and Bioengineering in the Department of Preventative and Restorative Dental Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, says that initially, bioglass was thought to be “bioconductive,” and simply provided the necessary components for tooth tissue to form. However, says Marshall, it was later found to be “bioinductive,” in that it actually “alters gene expression” and makes the tooth more effective in repairing itself. This means bioglass can serve as a building block to cover dentinal tubules, decreasing tooth sensitivity in the process.</p><p>In the mid-1990s, two University of Maryland dentists put bioglass into toothpaste, in the form of calcium sodium phosphosilicate, and saw dramatic results for treating tooth sensitivity. By 2007, the two had developed a marketable toothpaste, which the <em>Washington Examiner</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/additive-helps-teeth-rebuild-enamel">covered</a> in a story titled “Additive helps teeth rebuild enamel.” The product and company was called NovaMin, which sat under a larger company called US Biomaterials. In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/glaxosmithkline-acquires-novamin-technology-inc--86ef8ed5#section-overview">bought NovaMin for $135 million</a>. In 2011, the toothpaste was introduced across Europe.</p><p>“To know that our invention will now have a positive impact globally on dental pain and help those individuals suffering from sensitive teeth is very rewarding,” said Gary Hack, DDS, the co-inventor of NovaMin, in a 2011 announcement.</p><p>But eight years later, Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin is still not available in the U.S. Asked if and when GlaxoSmithKline applied for FDA approval for NovaMin, a spokesperson for the company said, “GSK Consumer Healthcare is unable to answer this question due to scientific research and commercial strategy confidentiality.” The spokesperson also added that “toothpaste with NovaMin and without fluoride has been cleared by FDA as a medical device for in-office use.”</p><p>An FDA spokesperson also weighed in, saying, “We cannot comment on why a product is not approved in the U.S. The company would need to discuss their marketing.”</p><p>There are a number of reasons — economic, social, technological, ecological, and legal — why a company might introduce a product in one market, but not another. But the company’s tight-lipped explanation has fueled speculation, and conspiracy theories, around the absence of Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin from the U.S. shelves.</p><p>One <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13365369">theory</a> claims GSK is in the pocket of “Big Dental.” In turn, the company is withholding NovaMin so that consumers have to pay for more expensive in-office procedures. <a href="https://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/gsk-drops-ball-with-puzzling-us-release-of-sensodyne-repair-protect-sans-45s5-glass">Another</a> theory argues that the FDA approved NovaMin for use in over the counter toothpaste, but had qualms with the term “Repair” in the name of the product.</p><p>“GSK couldn’t market the ‘Repair’ part because bioglass isn’t really repairing the enamel, just protecting it beyond fluoride,” says Leo. In a December 2016 post on Reddit’s Q&amp;A section r/IamA, a technician <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5iebf6/iama_technician_at_a_toothpaste_factory_ama/">claiming to work</a> in a toothpaste factory repeated the theory.</p><p>“NovaMin didn’t make it into U.S. markets due to regulatory obstacles, though my guess is Sensodyne/GSK is working on that. Making the label claim that the toothpaste restores enamel will really challenge the way toothpaste is currently registered/regulated by the FDA whereas the MHRA in the EU is very relaxed on toothpaste,” said user PasteGuy. (PasteGuy’s identity was not verified.)</p><p>Leo notes that at different times, Burt’s Bees and Dr. Collins both sold toothpaste products that contained the NovaMin compound under it’s nonbranded name, calcium sodium phosphosilicate. A<a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/burts_bees/natural_toothpastes/prweb3698464.htm"> 2010 press release</a> from Burt’s Bees confirms the existence of the product, and a 2014 <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/made-in-america-burts-bee_b_5178196">blog</a> from HuffPo lamented that it had been taken off the market. Today, a discontinued four pack of 4-ounce tubes of the stuff <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Natural-Toothpaste-Multicare/dp/B00394DVI2">sells for $49.99</a> on Amazon.</p><p>Terry* has been using toothpaste with NovaMin since 2015 and is a convert. “I have had no new cavities or needed any major dental work in that time. I had a few cavities filled prior to that, but I can’t recall right now how many filings I actually have,” she said over direct message on Reddit. Terry is based in the U.S., and buys her Sensodyne with Novamin from Amazon or Ebay.</p><p>Terry doesn’t know why the toothpaste isn’t sold in the U.S., but says, “I’m sure money is involved somehow. Possibly more money to be made through ‘remineralizing’ treatments in dental offices versus an at-home solution?”</p><p>For Terry, the absence of Sensodyne from drugstore shelves is a question of justice. “I’m not passionate about toothpaste but I get heated about pharmaceutical companies and using restrictive patents/copyrights to jack up prices for medications/products which could improve people’s health and lives.”</p><p>Conspiracy theories in dental care are not uncommon. A recent <em>Atlantic </em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/the-trouble-with-dentistry/586039/">feature</a> detailed how one dentist bilked customers for tens of thousands of dollars with superfluous treatments, as well as procedures charged for but never actually performed. Patients that have been taken advantage of are more likely to turn to conspiracy theories and self-guided research. For instance, a small but vocal community has long believed that water supplies around the country are fluoridated in order <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-great-public-health-conspiracy-73f7ac6fb4e0">to control the public’s behavior — a completely unfounded accusation.</a></p><p>Though none of the dental professionals I spoke with knew why Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin was not being sold in the United States, they suspected more benign reasons.</p><p>“I can’t imagine they’re making much money off of it keeping it so exclusive,” says Daniel Jeremy Lopez, a registered dental hygienist in New York, and a moderator of a dentistry and dental hygiene subreddit. But, he adds, “I don’t understand big pharmaceutical company motives.”</p><p>In an interview with<em> Elemental</em>, Hack likened the product to a cure-all that could undermine a billion dollar dental industry. But when pressed, he says, “I believe that it is possibly a business decision on the part of the manufacturer.”</p><p>Dr. Matthias Zehnder, head of the Division of Endodontology at University of Zürich, is puzzled by the obsession with the toothpaste, and, in an email correspondence, called the topic “somewhat enigmatic.” He referred to <a href="http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/gsk-drops-ball-with-puzzling-us-release-of-sensodyne-repair-protect-sans-45s5-glass">two</a> <a href="http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/biomin-bioglass-toothpaste-may-better-protect-sensitive-teeth-and-find-its-way-into-us-market">articles</a> from Ceramics.org that theorized why the product was not on U.S. shelves, and added his own take.</p><p>“It may be speculated that, because this Sensodyne toothpaste contains fluoride and bioglass 45S5 (NovaMin), it is considered to be a medication in the U.S. and thus the manufacturer refrained from keeping it on the market as such.”</p><p>“The toothpaste industry is a strange club,” he added. “They put all kinds of stuff in toothpaste and hope it helps. :-)”</p><p>Other medical professionals I spoke with questioned the supposed miracle powers of NovaMin. Dr. William Landis, PhD, a professor and Interim Division Chair in Department of Preventative and Restorative Dental Sciences in the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry, says, “Whether bioglass is as effective in its applications with teeth as it is with bone is conjectural… There are literature reports that bioglass is efficacious in some applications with teeth, but others that it is no more efficacious than products containing fluoride alone.”</p><p>Asked if he’d recommend NovaMin to his patients, Dr. Landis says “My outside perspective is that I am not aware of a risk, but I would also not recommend the product for remineralization compared to other products already on the U.S. market that contain fluoride. I believe the latter do a very good job in their own right without the need for an additional additive such as NovaMin.” In other words, he’s just as likely to recommend a NovaMin toothpaste as a standard tube of Colgate.</p><p>And though the internet is glowing with positive reviews for the stuff, not all NovaMin users will find relief.</p><p>Lopez first heard of NovaMin in dental school in 2012 and has followed the hype since. He says he would only recommend using the product “in extreme cases where other options have proved ineffective.” He is not an evangelist for Sensodyne with NovaMin.</p><p>“Novamin can only block up dentinal tubules, which means it really only works for inhibiting cold/fluid sensitivity. It does nothing to actually address irritable pulp/nerves. Only potassium nitrate can do that,” he says.</p><p>Lopez also points out that different treatments have different effects on different people. “There isn’t one magic compound that solves everyone’s problem,” Lopez said. He knows from personal experience. Lopez says he has tooth sensitivity, which he attributes to sensitive pulp. He has used NovaMin products for “a few months at a time.” He never felt relief.</p></div></div>',

I love meeting new people. As a result, I have been very fortunate to build an extensive network. The older I get, the more I realize how much this network has helped me get to where I am today. People underestimate the value of networking in their success. Most would say absolute success (vs. relative success) is the result of a combination of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-success-come-mostly-from-talent-hard-work-mdash-or-luck/">talent, hard work and luck</a>. If you don’t have any talent, you are unlikely to offer anything of value to others. If you don’t work hard, you can’t hone your talent and build something of value. And even if you have all the talent in the world and you work non-stop, you need luck to get you exposure and opportunity. I would add that building the right network can increase your odds of success. In other words, <strong>you can create your own luck when you have a strong network.</strong></p><p>I was inspired to write this post after coming across this article <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hollywood-before-social-media-killed-stars-nightlife-1172719">Before Social Media Killed Hollywood Nightlife</a> in the Hollywood Reporter. I was fascinated by seeing all of these young actors cavorting in L.A. clubs before they became famous celebrities. I wondered how many were already famous before these photos were taken and most were still unknowns at the time (circa 2001). You can see a photo of a young <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0597388/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">Jason Momoa</a> ten years prior to his breakout role as Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones and now the billion dollar Aquaman. There’s a photo of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424060/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Scarlett Johansson</a> who wouldn’t have her breakout role in Lost in Translation until 2003. It would make sense if they were already celebrities that they would run in the same social circles, but that was not the case. It seems like too much of a coincidence that so many of the photos show so many young actors and actresses together before they made it. Obviously these are selective photos and there are probably dozens of others with people who didn’t make it big, but the fact remains that these future Oscar-winners and blockbuster movie stars were connected before they were famous. One must wonder to what degree they helped one another get there along the way through introductions and access.</p><figure><figcaption>Punani Thursdays at The Lounge in the early 2000s drew (from left) Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Gwen Stefani, now-cryptocurrency entrepreneur Les Borsai and, crouching, actor Taj Johnson. Source: Pantera Sarah</figcaption></figure><p>Just the other day, I was visiting the Gauguin exhibit at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco. I noticed that <a href="https://www.gauguingallery.com/pissarros-influence-on-gauguin.aspx">Paul Gauguin was friends with Camille Pissarro</a> and it struck me how many of the masters were socially acquainted. I always thought that it was an odd coincidence that the great Impressionists were all friends (and they were most definitely not already famous at the time). In fact, most of them were rejects of the prestigious Paris Salon and were forced to exhibit their work at the Salon des Refusés (French for exhibition of rejects) in 1863. Paul Cézanne briefly attended the Atelier Suisse with Camille Pissarro and in 1862 became lifelong friends with Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet. In 1894, he visited Monet in Giverny who introduced Cézanne to Auguste Rodin and critic Gustave Geffroy. Once again, it clearly is too much of a coincidence that all of these great artists knew one another before they became famous. A week after I saw the exhibit I came upon this timely article: <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-artists-famous-friends-originality-work">Artists Become Famous through Their Friends, Not the Originality of Their Work</a>. This <a href="https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/inventingabstraction/?page=connections">interactive network diagram</a> from the MoMa demonstrates the power of connections with Wassily Kandinsky and Pablo Picasso in the center. The study performed by Columbia Business School professor Paul Ingram and his colleague Mitali Banerjee, of HEC Paris, found that “artists with a large and diverse network of contacts were most likely to be famous, regardless of how creative their art was…Specifically, the greatest predictor of fame for an artist was having a network of contacts from various countries.”</p><figure><figcaption>Andy Warhol, Photograph of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Bryan Ferry, Julian Schnabel, Jacqueline Beaurang, Paige Powell, and others at a party Julian Schnabel’s Apartment.

All of this assumes a minimum base level of talent in order to succeed or even be accepted into the network. I dreamed of being the first Asian-American NBA star as a ten year-old. But it wouldn’t have mattered how many NBA scouts, GMs or owners I knew, because I didn’t have the physical talent or basketball IQ to be Jeremy Lin (although I did have a mean jump shot). The point is that in order to improve your chances of success, you need to invest in your network. <strong>Your network can grant you access to opportunities</strong>.</p><h3>I am Not Throwing Away My Shot</h3><p>You still need talent to succeed, but a lot of people are talented. Your network helps you break out by giving you a chance. If you look at the works of the great masters and objectively compare them to other artists of that time that did not become famous, I doubt you would really be able to tell the difference. There are many actors or singers who are just as talented as those who are celebrities, but they just never got their shot. Platforms like YouTube have somewhat leveled the playing field. You can go on YouTube and find tens of thousands of amazing voices and because of the disintermediation of record labels, more unknowns who didn’t previously have access or a network have <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube">managed to break out</a> (Justin Bieber, Alessia Cara, Shawn Mendes, etc.).</p></div><div><figure><figcaption>The PayPal Mafia.

Access gives you a leg up on your competition and helps you win. Social capital leads to human capital and financial capital. When you know the right people you can recruit the best talent through your network and you can get in front of the best investors. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-paypal-mafia-the-richest-group-of-men-in-silicon-valley-2014-9">The PayPal Mafia</a> is the prime example of the power of your network. Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim were all at PayPal before starting YouTube which was funded by Sequoia partner Roelof Botha who was also at PayPal. Jeremy Stoppelman started Yelp with Russel Simmons and was funded by Max Levchin, all PayPal alumni. Yes, individually they were all talented and had the potential to succeed, but having those critical relationships improved their odds.</p><p>As an early employee at Yahoo!, I was fortunate enough to know many of those who went on to do amazing things. My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/albertlee">Albert Lee</a> was a fellow product manager who went on to build <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">MyFitnessPal</a> into a $500 million company and raised money from <a href="https://www.accel.com/team/andrew-braccia">Andrew Braccia</a>, who was in business development with us at Yahoo! long before he became the influential partner at <a href="https://www.accel.com/">Accel</a> that went on to invest in Slack, Etsy, HotelTonight, 99Designs and Braintree. Albert is now an investor in my company Pared. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/silicon-valley-network-mafias.html">next generation of mafias</a> are coming out of the unicorns of Uber and AirBnb as some graduate to the venture world and others become founders that they invest in. Powerful networks such as Y Combinator, a handful of MBA programs and premium portfolios such as First Round Capital are force multipliers for these networks.</p><p>Networks grant access. Access increases opportunities. Capitalizing on opportunities leads to success. Timing and talent are important factors, but having the right network to leverage when you need it vastly improves your probability of success. In other words, like in surfing, you have to be in the right position to catch the big wave when it comes. Your network sets you up to take advantage of that wave instead of being behind and desperately paddling to catch up it.</p><h3>How to Build Your Network</h3><p>There are no shortcuts to building a strong network. You can add all of the random connections on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn and your network could still be worthless. A network is only as strong as the individual relationships and connections you have. If you only have weak ties, it’s unlikely you will be able to leverage them in a time of need. In other words, <strong>quality &gt; quantity</strong>. The Silicon Valley mafias exist because those people went to war together in the trenches. They created strong bonds through good times and bad while building startups into empires. Not everyone can have that type of shared experience, but there are other ways you can build your network with authentic connections:</p><h4>Create Value for Others</h4><p>People want to connect with you if you have something of value to offer. This is where the talent comes into play, because hopefully you have something to offer! This doesn’t have to be monetary or physical, it could be your expertise or access to your network. I get requests for introductions from friends and acquaintances all of the time because they see I’m connected to someone. I also get requests to meet up to give advice on building startups, growth marketing, fundraising, hiring and other insights from my personal experience. One way to amplify your expertise and value to others who are not in your sphere of influence is to blog or write thought leadership pieces (like this one!). If you can prove your content is worthy of the validation of the masses, people will ask you to speak on panels and do podcast interviews and more. This will continue to expand the audience who find value in your ideas. I recently wrote <a href="https://hackernoon.com/not-all-marketplaces-are-created-equal-tales-of-a-marketplace-founder-9fc0fb802706">one Medium post</a> about marketplaces that went viral and it was shared by influencers and people I respect but never interacted with before. The post led to new incredibly valuable relationships. <strong>When you create value for others, people will want to connect with you which will in turn increase the size and value of your network = Flywheel.</strong></p><h4>Stay Connected</h4><p>Add people on LinkedIn because it is how other people will find value in your network. I get requests for introductions all the time to people I’m connected to. I only accept invitations or connections to people I’ve actually interacted with. That way I can always reference that interaction or how we met when reaching back out again, even if it was years ago. Don’t randomly accept all of the spammy invites you get from people wanting to connect because “I came across your profile and wanted to connect!” Ignore. You will only dilute your network if you accept random connections. When someone in the future asks you for an introduction to someone and you have no context or idea how you’re connected, it will be very awkward to say you don’t really know them. People use LinkedIn to measure the value of your network as a reflection of you. They subconsciously signal off of how many mutual connections you have and the quality of those connections. I’m not saying it’s a perfect proxy for someone’s talent or ability, but people use whatever cues they have to evaluate others worth, and your network is one of them.</p><figure><figcaption>At least put a little effort into it.</figcaption></figure><h4>Never Be Afraid to Ask</h4><p>Not many people know this, but I’ve been friends with Guy Kawasaki for years. I was starting my first company at the time and was so inspired by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Start-Time-Tested-Battle-Hardened-Starting/dp/1591840562/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=the+art+of+the+start&amp;qid=1552536329&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3">The Art of the Start</a> that I decided to cold e-mail him for his advice. He actually responded and we had breakfast a week later. Over the years, we would get together and talk about social media and marketing. Guy is one of the best in the business of building a personal brand and I’ve learned so much from him. I would never have benefited from all of his sage wisdom if I hadn’t e-mailed him. Never be afraid to reach out to someone, because the worst response you can get is a “no” or no response at all. You shouldn’t take it personally because anyone worth getting to know is probably very busy. I can almost guarantee you that if you reach out to a busy CEO or influencer with a personalized e-mail about their product/service, book, essay, or speech that they will at the very least take the time to write a response. They might even respond with an invitation to have breakfast with them.</p><h4>Don’t Limit Yourself to One Network or Domain</h4><p>If you always socialize in the same circles, you will never expand your network. Seeing the same people regularly either because of shared industry, interests or geography limits the new relationships you can make. Spend time fostering relationships in different domains and industries. Andrew Chau, the founder of Boba Guys, is quite possibly one of the most well-connected people I know. Andrew has invested time and energy in building bridges across industries from food to politics to entertainment to fashion to sports to tech. His network is extremely valuable to many because its reach extends across the country and around the globe. By crossing over into different industries, he multiplies the number of other supernodes he is connected to which amplifies his network. The thing is, Andrew rarely asks for anything, he is always giving and creating value for others. Oftentimes this value comes from his connections and access. In other words, his network helps him create value for his network (very meta). He also happens to be an ingenious marketer who is deeply plugged in to cultural trends.</p><h4>Always Be Supportive</h4><p>Everyone appreciates it when you support them in their efforts no matter how much. If someone is launching a product, tweet about it or share it with your network. If someone is fundraising ask if you can be helpful with introductions. If someone has successfully fundraised, congratulate them publicly. If someone has news to share, help them share it to a wider audience. No matter who you are, when you have something you’re trying to promote, you will always appreciate those who support you in your endeavors. Whenever I publish a new essay on Medium, I’m always thankful to those who retweet it or share it because it drives more traffic and readership.</p><h4>Say Yes and Don’t Expect Anything in Return</h4><p>Be generous with your time. Your time is valuable, but if you only do things because you’ll selfishly get something out of it, then you will often end up being disappointed. I am very intentional about being open to helping others. I don’t help them because I expect anything in return, I do it because I can. Pay it forward. If I can help someone else with my expertise or network, then why wouldn’t I meet with them? This openness has paid back dividends tenfold in what I’ve spent in time. People I’ve helped along the way have made incredibly valuable introductions, asked me to be an advisor, and have given me critical advice in return. Those who believe in karma can relate to this. Obviously you only have so many hours in the day so you can’t always be responsive, but you can always be open.</p><h4>Be Proactive and Connect Others</h4><p>When you have an extensive network, you will have a lot of opportunities to connect people who would otherwise not intersect. As a node, you will be the only one who can see the valuable potential between two of your friends. Whether you’re connecting a founder to an investor or a customer to a buyer, there are countless reasons to bring two people together. Malcolm Gladwell refers to these natural hubs and human supernodes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference-ebook/dp/B000OT8GD0">The Tipping Point</a> as “connectors”. By creating opportunities for others, people will be extremely grateful and may potentially return the favor down the road. Got rejected by Y Combinator or Stanford Business School? Start a force multiplying community of your own. Bring like-minded people together whether it be online or offline. When others see that you are a connector, they will refer more people to you and the group. Before you know it, you will have created a valuable network for yourself and more importantly for others.</p><figure><figcaption>Hunter Walk knows a lot of good people and is a proactive connector.</figcaption></figure><p>I hate “networking” as much as the next person. When I see a someone superficially schmoozing, I roll my eyes too. People can generally tell when someone is trying too hard and clearly just want something. The people with the strongest networks are the ones who build real relationships because those are the ties that you can count on. Friends always ask me how I know so many people. My superpower is that I have a somewhat photographic memory for faces which helps me to remember people, although this has declined with age. I could remember someone I met only briefly over twenty years ago or see a photo of someone and remember the context (this has definitely freaked people out). This has obviously been a powerful gift when building my network, but it’s more important that I remember the things that matter to people I meet because I care enough to remember. Be yourself. Be authentic. If you genuinely care about people, they will sense that. <strong>Invest generously in others and you will see returns for a lifetime.</strong></p><p>If you enjoyed this post, please check out some of my other Medium articles:</p><figure><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/swlh"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*YqDjlKFwScoQYQ62DWEdig.png"></a></p></div></figure><h4>This story is published in <a href="https://medium.com/swlh">The Startup</a>, Medium’s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +439,678 people.</h4><h4>Subscribe to receive <a href="https://growthsupply.com/the-startup-newsletter/">our top stories here</a>.</h4><figure><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/swlh"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ouK9XR4xuNWtCes-TIUNAw.png"></a></p></div></figure></div></div></div></div>',

It’s a never-ending path of obstacles from start to finish. The struggle is inevitable, but the way you frame your setbacks is completely up to you and the way you make decisions to overcome them may be the very thing that helps you succeed.</p><p>It’s human nature to avoid pain and seek pleasure, but entrepreneurs are always on a different level than the rest. They take risks where others play it safe. They fend off comfort zones in the name of progress, even when it means potential failure.</p><p>But the path isn’t an easy road, and the survival rate for startups is low. Talent, knowledge, skills, and experience may be building blocks of success, but often it’s the mental ability of the individual that drives them ahead. The process of adapting well in the face of adversity is a valuable quality for those looking to start or grow a business.</p><p>For entrepreneurs, the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties is about rethinking the way you see setbacks and viewing them as catalysts of growth and progress rather than threats. Because the truth is, obstacles help you grow as a person when you’re faced with extremely difficult problems and decisions.</p><p>Having this ability is crucial if you want your business and your career as an entrepreneur to grow and last. Like any shift in thinking, it doesn’t happen overnight, but there are practical steps you can take immediately to build quick decision-making skills and become better equipped to handle setbacks as you start and grow your business. Setbacks are unavoidable, and they’re not pleasant, but they also have the potential to be your engine of personal growth.</p><p>Startups face all sorts of challenges that relate to market, hiring, product, funding, and customer service. There’s no shortage of setbacks you could run into. To build quick decision making skills to overcome obstacles, firstly you will need to rethink what appears to be negative: a failed business, a failed product launch, an app that none downloads and realizing that, is actually helpful for future growth and success.</p><p>An entrepreneur looks past short-term setbacks and focuses on long-term goals. The unadaptable entrepreneur gets caught up in temporary problems; they can’t see through, so it’s easier to quit or get distracted, to work on something else rather than to face the blunt facts of their situation. The difference between success and failure often comes down to who’s willing to stick it out in the smartest way, and that’s not necessarily related to talent, skill or education. That’s how you develop skills to overcome any obstacles that may be ahead of you during your entrepreneurial career.</p><p>The truth is that those with quick decision-making skills and a positive attitude often have an easier time facing challenges, simply because they’ll be less likely to give up quickly. They’ll be steadfast. Facing obstacles head on can translate to finding solutions more quickly, because you’re not avoiding or ignoring the unpleasant facts before you.</p><p>Resilience keeps a successful entrepreneur moving even when you can’t see the finish line. Resilience is what measures your success. It’s what makes a good entrepreneur. Resourcefulness and optimism help entrepreneurs to catapult their business over that distant horizons. Resilience predicts your success, it’s one of the most important factors in an entrepreneur’s life.</p><p>It isn’t only about getting your company off the ground – sometimes it benefits you when you’ve failed and you’re ready to start again. Entrepreneurs who are starting their second business after an initial, failed attempt are significantly more likely to find success in their second company. If you’re resilient, the odds are in your favor. If you’re an entrepreneur, you know how important it is to have people believe in you. Whether it’s the CEO of a company, an influencer who could boost your career to new places or a potential investor – people need to believe in you. They want to see your potential in order to invest in your startup. But they’re relying on you to tell them what you can do – so if you don’t believe it, neither will anyone else. If your confidence level falls just before a meeting, trust your interviewer to notice your resilience, which might make the difference between making or breaking the deal.</p><p>So, if you’re an entrepreneur, be resilient to overcome any obstacles that may be ahead of you during your career.</p></div></div></div></div>',

running an obstacle race. It’s a never-ending path of obstacles from start to finish. The struggle is inevitable, but the way you frame your setbacks is completely up to you and&nbsp;the way you make decisions to overcome them may be the very thing that helps you succeed.</p><p name="29a3" id="29a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s human nature to avoid pain and seek pleasure, but entrepreneurs are always on a different level than the rest. They take risks where others play it safe. They fend off comfort zones in the name of progress, even when it means potential failure.</p><p name="011d" id="011d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the path isn’t an easy road, and the&nbsp;survival rate for startups&nbsp;is low. Talent, knowledge, skills, and experience may be building blocks of success, but often it’s the mental ability of the individual that drives them ahead. The process of adapting well in the face of adversity is a valuable quality for those looking to start or grow a business.</p><p name="5c52" id="5c52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For entrepreneurs, the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties is about rethinking the way you see setbacks and viewing them as catalysts of growth and progress rather than threats. Because the truth is, obstacles help you grow as a person when you’re faced with extremely difficult problems and decisions.</p><p name="fcd3" id="fcd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having this ability is crucial if you want your business and your career as an entrepreneur to grow and last. Like any shift in thinking, it doesn’t happen overnight, but there are practical steps you can take immediately to build quick decision-making skills and become better equipped to handle setbacks as you start and grow your business. Setbacks are unavoidable, and they’re not pleasant, but they also have the potential to be your engine of personal growth.</p><p name="a6e3" id="a6e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Startups face all sorts of challenges that relate to market, hiring, product, funding, and customer service. There’s no shortage of setbacks you could run into. To build quick decision making skills to overcome obstacles, firstly you will need to rethink what appears to be negative: a&nbsp;failed business, a failed product launch, an app that none downloads and realizing that, is actually helpful for future growth and success.</p><p name="ce75" id="ce75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An entrepreneur looks past short-term setbacks and focuses on long-term goals. The unadaptable entrepreneur gets caught up in temporary problems; they can’t see through, so it’s easier to quit or get distracted, to work on something else rather than to face the blunt facts of their situation. The difference between success and failure often comes down to who’s&nbsp;willing to stick it out&nbsp;in the smartest way, and that’s not necessarily related to talent, skill or education. That’s how you develop skills to overcome any obstacles that may be ahead of you during your entrepreneurial career.</p><p name="f2c4" id="f2c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is that those with quick decision-making skills and a positive attitude often have an easier time facing challenges, simply because they’ll be less likely to give up quickly. They’ll be steadfast. Facing obstacles head on can translate to finding solutions more quickly, because you’re not avoiding or ignoring the unpleasant facts before you.</p><p name="bc3e" id="bc3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Resilience keeps a successful entrepreneur moving even when you can’t see the finish line.&nbsp;Resilience&nbsp;is what measures your success. It’s what makes a good entrepreneur.&nbsp;Resourcefulness and optimism help entrepreneurs to catapult their business over that distant horizons. Resilience predicts your success, it’s one of the most important factors in an entrepreneur’s life.</p><p name="78b4" id="78b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It isn’t only about getting your company off the ground – sometimes it benefits you when you’ve failed and you’re ready to start again. Entrepreneurs who are starting their second business after an initial, failed attempt are significantly more likely to find success in their second company. If you’re resilient, the odds are&nbsp;in your favor. If you’re an entrepreneur, you know how important it is to have&nbsp;people believe&nbsp;in you. Whether it’s the CEO of a company, an influencer who could boost your career to new places or a potential investor – people need to believe in you. They want to see your potential in order to invest in your startup. But they’re relying on you to tell them what you can do – so if you don’t believe it, neither will anyone else. If your confidence level falls just before a meeting, trust your interviewer to notice your resilience, which might make the difference between making or breaking the deal.</p><p name="8505" id="8505" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So, if you’re an entrepreneur, be resilient to overcome any obstacles that may be ahead of you during your career.</p></div></div></section><section

With actual dollars.</p><p>I’m going to be nuanced on this one because I used to do something similar. In fact, it’s pretty common. At the very beginning of the startup cycle, unless the founder is independently wealthy or incredibly risk-tolerant or enviably well-connected, there’s no money and no one is getting paid.</p><p>It’s very difficult and time consuming to get an idea into reality on one’s own. It takes a broad skill set, a lot of iterative work, and a bunch of lucky breaks for one person to create a minimum viable product, validate it, and start generating revenue from it. Invariably, that single individual will need help, and if there’s no money and no access to it, they will need an alternative means of remuneration.</p><p>That alternative is usually promises. And promises in startup are always, <em>always</em> a bridge built to burn.</p><h4>“I’m losing them.”</h4><p>Yesterday, I got an <a href="https://www.joeprocopio.com/#help">email via my website</a> from “Chad,” a founder working on a new startup with volunteers for staff. He admits straight up that the lack of pay is due to his own lack of funds, but he’s looking forward to paying them all a salary as soon as possible.</p><p>The problem is, as Chad puts it, their productivity has fallen off despite the promise of wages down the road. He puts this on himself and his lack of leadership. What does he do?</p><p>Oof. Chad. Buddy. I think you skipped a bunch of steps.</p><h4>First things first: Nothing is free</h4><p>We founders need to understand that nothing in startup comes without a cost. Nothing. I went to great lengths a few weeks ago to drive this point home and put some quantification around it with a post called <a href="https://medium.com/@jproco/you-need-250-000-to-start-a-company-886298e8cf7e?source=friends_link&amp;sk=9fbcc16a6994db38cf8ddfc99c31111b">You Need $250,000 To Start a Company</a>.</p><p>I had detractors, of course, but I stand behind my point 100%. No matter how we pay for it — with sweat equity, paper equity, time, cash, or opportunity cost — we’re going to end up spending the equivalent of about a quarter-million to turn an idea into something that can sustain itself. Even if those costs are hidden or, more to the point, obfuscated.</p><p>Yeah, if we’re making promises to volunteers, all we’re doing is slyly shifting some of our costs to them and/or the future.</p><p>So the first question a founder needs to ask themselves is this: If we’re not willing to raise, find, beg, borrow, or steal cash to pay other people to turn our idea into a reality, then how much do we believe in our idea?</p><p>If the answer is still “very much,” then let’s cautiously look at those alternatives.</p><h4>Selling the future</h4><p>The first go-to alternative is equity, and that’s always a thorny issue. There are a lot of ways to screw up the distribution of equity in the first days of startup, but they all have the same root cause. Here are just a few of those problems:</p><p>Problem #1: The founder hands out too much equity to employees too early, leaving very little for investors to purchase with real money.</p><p>Problem #2: The founder doesn’t vest the employee equity, meaning the employees own a chunk of the company on their first day, even if they leave or get arrested or harass someone.</p><p>Problem #3: The founder hands out 1,000 or 1,000,000 shares and nobody knows what that means, including the founder.</p><p>All these problems start with the founder not properly valuing the equity from the beginning.</p><p>Make your own jokes about how much early stage startup equity is worth in relation to the paper it isn’t even printed on anymore. The fact is the reverse is always true. When we use equity as compensation, we’re selling the future of the company and we’re painting ourselves into a corner in terms of both dollars and time.</p><p>Always decide how much the future value of those options is worth, always vest them over three years, and always explain to the employee what percentage of the company they’re getting and where we think the value will be at the end of the vesting period.</p><p>Also, we shouldn’t expect an employee to put in $250,000 worth of work for $250,000 worth of equity. They’d be an idiot if they did that. We’re looking at a ratio, could be 10 to 1, could be 100 to 1, and this is where the next factor comes into play.</p><h4>Passion and risk</h4><p>When we ask people to work for free, we’re really just spending passion to pay for risk.</p><p>People will go to great lengths to help something succeed that they’re passionate about. This is the true root of volunteerism. If we believe in something, we’ll do just about anything for it.</p><p>So in order to get people to work for us for free, they need to:</p><ol><li>Believe in the idea.</li><li>Believe in the founder.</li><li>Believe in the process.</li></ol><p>We tap that passion to overcome these risks:</p><ol><li>Ideas have no value on their own. They are simply a means to an end. The best idea is world peace. I believe in that. I’m also a realist.</li><li>No one has the magic formula for startup. No one. It’s very Catch-22 that the most successful founders are the ones who least need free labor. There’s a reason for that.</li><li>This has never been done before.</li></ol><p>While the idea and the founder are somewhat static risks, the last risk, the process to get the idea to successful product, is one that needs continuous mitigation. This is where Chad is losing the motivation and the productivity of his volunteers. They’re losing faith in the process.</p><h4>Transparency and timeline</h4><p>From the very first pitch to the prospective free employee to the moment we cut them their first salary check, we need to sell them on the idea that the process will work. There’s a right way and a wrong way to do that, and if we take advantage of people, it’s going to come back on us.</p><p>The wrong way can lead to the incredible scamminess we’ll find in something like Fyre Fest or Theranos. (Most) People wanted those things to succeed for the right reasons: For the former, an immersive and interactive social experience, and for the latter, inexpensive and less-invasive blood testing. The founders then preyed on those ideals to obtain products, services, and money with zero or deferred remuneration.</p><p>This isn’t every startup, obviously, but the bullet points are there. What happens is vague promises get made. Then inevitably one party claims those promises got broken while the other party either parses the promise or denies the promise ever got made.</p><p>The right way to employ free labor is with transparency and on a timeline.</p><p>The issue with free labor is rarely the lack of pay, it’s <em>how long</em> the labor goes without pay. This is because most free labor is acquired during the heady, exciting early days with the promise of “We’ll figure it out later.”</p><p>Yeah, don’t do that.</p><p>Transparency happens in writing, explaining what the expectations are for their output and how much time we need from them on a weekly basis. We should also be clear about where they fit in the company’s eventual hierarchy. Are they a co-founder? Are they a C-Suite employee? Will they be?</p><p>A clear definition of the value of any non-cash compensation as described above is also a must. And then finally it should be noted how much money the founder has or has access to and what that money is going to be used for.</p><p>A timeline should be laid out that explains, at a minimum, the events that need to happen for the employee to start getting paid, what kind of schedule might be used to get that pay up to something decent, and how long we believe it might take.</p><p>Never make it indefinite because when we do that we’re putting the employee on a short runway alone. We need to be on that runway as well. If we can’t pay them within, say, six months, then we need to fold up and go home.</p><p>And a word of warning — when I say we need to fold up and go home, we can’t pause and start over. Imagine what happens when we lay off our free labor and then we do succeed. Those people we cut out have a case against us, and believe me they will make that case.</p><h4>Can we retro?</h4><p>So what does Chad do here? Is it possible for him to retroactively apply what we’ve laid out here and take this transparency and timeline to each of his volunteers and get them to re-up?</p><p>Absolutely it’s possible. That’s what leadership is. And I daresay that’s what’s missing. He’ll lose a bunch of them, for sure, but at this point, it’s the only right way to move his company forward unless he’s prepared to start paying everyone today.</p></div></div></div></div>',

Frustrated, I yelled something nasty back, even though I knew he couldn’t hear me — which frustrated me, too.</p><p>Even minor annoyances like these can create a domino effect. The first annoyance magnifies each one that follows, all of them building on each other until you’ve worked yourself into a full-on bad mood.</p><p>“When you’re in a bad mood or having a bad day, it’s easy to chalk it up to bad luck,” says Kate Hanley, a personal development coach and author of <a href="https://katehanley.com/books/"><em>How to Be a Better Person</em></a>, “which makes it feel as if you’re helpless to do anything about it.”</p><p>But there are ways you can successfully lessen your negative reactions before they escalate. When you feel the day spiraling away from you, simply noticing that you’re in a funk is an important first step toward getting out of it. Here are a few ways to pull yourself out of a bad mood before it gets too big to control.</p><h3>Pinpoint what’s gone wrong</h3><p>Rather than resign yourself to staying crabby, Hanley suggests looking for specific triggers, like getting a bad night’s sleep or having unresolved feelings about something someone said to you. “When you can look and see that there is a legitimate reason why you’re in a bad mood, it helps dispel that sense of doom and gloom,” she explains.</p><p>Triggers can be physical, too. For instance, I have a bad habit of drinking too much coffee and little else, turning me into a jittery, dehydrated mess. According to Hanley, a small detail like this can be a contributing factor to a bad mood—and one that might be easily overlooked.</p><p>Hanley suggests asking yourself when the bad mood started and what set it off. “Maybe you snapped at your co-worker because you have a headache that you’ve been trying to pretend isn’t really there,” she says. And when you look at why you have a headache — possibly caused by, say, ingesting five coffees — now you know something concrete you can do to help yourself feel better, such as drinking a glass of water, massaging your neck and temples, or taking a pain reliever. “It shifts you from reactive to proactive.”</p><h3>Analyze your emotions</h3><p>“Emotions are a secondary response,” says Lee J. Colan, founder of leadership consulting firm The L Group and author of <a href="https://www.thelgroup.com/resources/power-positive-coaching"><em>The Power of Positive Coaching</em></a>. “There’s generally something underlying the raw emotion, and having awareness of that enables you to respond in the correct way.” When I yelled back at that other driver, I was reflexively reacting. But angrily lingering on the interaction for the rest of the day was a choice — and one that only aggravated my mood.</p><blockquote>“Even saying to yourself, ‘Wow, I’m in a bad mood,’ can be just the opening to ask yourself, ‘What do I most need right now?’”</blockquote><p>Give yourself the space to step back from your immediate emotional reactions and reflect on them, says Leslie Becker-Phelps, a licensed psychologist and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KBEHMJ2/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0"><em>Insecure in Love</em></a>. By thinking critically about the situation and your role in it, you can create some distance from your emotions, which in turn allows you to gain more control over how you’re feeling.</p><h3>Practice finding the upside…</h3><p>When faced with a setback, even a small one — you forget your password for the umpteenth time, or a meeting gets rescheduled yet again — it’s easy to let yourself fall into a steady stream of complaints.</p><p>“The human brain is wired to look for threats,” Hanley says. Evolutionarily, this helped keep us alive — but in modern-day life, threats can look a lot more like minor annoyances, creating a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3652533/">negativity bias</a> that keeps us focused on what’s going wrong. “To bust out of this neural rut,” she says, “train yourself to acknowledge when things go right.”</p><p>To that end, Colan recommends writing down three things that went well each day for two weeks and what your role was in each of those things. “It’s a way for you to say, ‘I had a positive impact,’” Colan says. “And I don’t care how much of a bummer your day is, there’s always a couple of things that went well.” The more attuned you are to this fact, the better equipped you’ll be to consciously respond with positivity the next time things go wrong.</p><h3>…And giving the benefit of the doubt</h3><p>When you feel powerless against the whims of the universe, it’s easy to overlook the one thing you do have control over: your empathy. “If we’re just reacting, we’re kind of taking our choice away,” Colan says. “We’re saying, ‘Here’s the stimulus. I’m reacting.’ But I think the more emotionally mature response is to say, ‘Alright, even though it feels quick, I have a choice here.’”</p><p>When you’re in a bad mood, choosing to empathize with the person who set you off can be a way of stopping yourself from stewing in your own hard feelings. But in the moment, being able to simply wave off an offense without reacting is much easier said than done.</p><p>“It’s really about creating a practice of empathy over time, which means identifying why the other person might feel the way they do,” Colan says. Think of it as a constant thought experiment. If a colleague’s giving you a hard time, for example, imagine what their own stressors might be — maybe they have a sick child at home, or a costly car repair, or something else you’d have no way of knowing about. The trick is to retrain your mind enough that this empathy becomes an immediate reflex, so that you can harness it before you let something derail your mood and your day. That’s a skill that comes with time and practice.</p><h3>Cut yourself some slack</h3><p>Personal change takes time and effort. Getting upset with yourself for not being able to change your emotional state will only make it worse. Instead, try using your bad mood as an excuse to practice a little self-compassion.</p><p>“You can’t change something — a habit, a mood, or a bad day — without acknowledging that you don’t like what’s currently happening,” Hanley says. “Even saying to yourself, ‘Wow, I’m in a bad mood,’ can be just the opening to ask yourself, ‘What do I most need right now?’”</p><p>Maybe you just need a break, and you can go outside for 10 minutes at lunch instead of running an errand or eating at your desk. Hanley recommends playing your favorite music on the way home instead of listening to the news.</p><p>But to make that happen, you have to admit that you need it in the first place. Make an effort to regularly check in with yourself throughout the day for what you need in a given moment — whether it’s a glass of water or a quick walk around the block. Colan says there’s a level of mindfulness to it: “One of the key things to get through any point of adversity—even if it’s just a bad mood or rough day—you have to plan for the future but live in the present.”</p><p>Taking that idea and zooming out with it, you can also use your past experience to help you: Look back at previous rough patches and see how everything ended up working out. You’ve gotten through plenty of bad moods in the past, and you’ll do it again — and reminding yourself that this is temporary may help speed the process along.</p></div></div></div></div></div>',

      html: '<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At this year’s <a href="https://summit.adobe.com/na/">Adobe Summit</a> in Las Vegas, the mission to change the world through digital experiences was gathering pace. There was something for everyone from empowering people to create and transforming how business compete to giving away one-year subscriptions for <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/premiere-rush.html">Adobe Rush video</a> to all of the 17,000 attendees.</p><p>Amazon, Uber, Airbnb, and Netflix have all played a part in raising the expectation levels of their consumers across the globe. But many businesses  are currently faced with a continuously increasing pile of data and asking the question, “I want to know what will happen, not what has already happened.”</p><p>People are buying experiences, not products was the key message. But nobody says I cannot wait to see if there is a mattress sale in my Gmail and if you do, you are weird said Marketo CEO, Steve Lucas. In a world where nobody likes to be sold to, it’s clear that we need to think differently and even redefine the customer journey entirely.</p><p>The “Sneaks” event at Adobe Summit is one of the company’s major innovation programs. Built on the belief that great ideas can come from anywhere, Adobe provides all of its staff with an open invitation to submit their game-changing ideas for a chance to present their work in front of 17,000 people. This year, the event is hosted by Mindy Kaling where the top 7 projects leveraged technology trends from AI and mixed reality, to voice.</p><p>Before the event, I got hands-on with an AI assistant for Slack that promises to help teams leverage data insights for decision making while automating content editing. It also leverages Adobe Sensei, the company’s AI and machine learning platform. All the familiar buzzwords were present, but what problem does it solve?</p><p>For many teams of creatives, Slack has become the collaboration tool of choice to share ideas, address problems in real-time and even <a href="https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2019/03/03/enterprise-social-mediaslack-improve-well-being-workplace/">improve your well-being</a>. The ability to work seamlessly together in a digital utopia outside of the increasingly dated looking email inbox offers obvious appeal. But, actionable insights during the creation process are noticeably absent from the current collaboration methods.</p><p>Project Expert Assist, the AI assistant acts as a virtual bridge between the company’s dataset and creatives. In a marketing campaign, teams often explore content will resonate with their audience. A simple “/sensei openrate” command instantly enables a creative team to propose a different line of copy and allow the AI assistant to predict the open rate. If it is low, the team can brainstorm more copy — all without leaving Slack.</p><p>Adobe Sensei can already deeply understand the language of digital content such as images, videos, animations, and illustrations. It has allowed Adobe’s AI to understand not only objects in a picture but more complex concepts like composition, aesthetic qualities, and color palette.</p><p>What makes Project Expert Assist so intriguing is that it brings all of these capabilities directly into Slack for seamless collaboration. Another notable command, “/sensei placetext” can then automatically insert the copy into the different variations—in an intuitive way that does not disrupt the creative.</p><p>Unfortunately, this and all of the “Sneaks” showcased at the Adobe Summit in front of an excited audience are still just research projects at this point. But, Adobe has a good record of rolling ideas such as Expert Assist into future products</p><p>The possibility of leveraging data insights for decision making, while automating content editing and all without leaving Slack will be a mouth-watering prospect for many. But this latest proof of concept also reveals a fresh approach to content analysis and attempts to redefine the creation process.</p><p>At this years summit, Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen advised that “Overcoming organizational and data silos are key to putting customers at the center of your digital business and delivering a leading experience.” Expert Assist seems to address this very real problem directly with an AI assistant and a handful of Slack commands.</p><p>As data-driven decision making becomes increasingly important to marketers, creatives need the flexibility to automate repetitive and cumbersome tasks. For these reasons alone, I think this is one R&amp;D project that we will be seeing much more of in the future.</p><p>This post is part of our contributor series.

Assistant manager of this. Co-assistant manager of this. Supervisor. The supervisor’s supervisor.</p><p>Others try to change the perception of their role with a new title, like Director of First Impressions (receptionist), Sandwich Technician (Subway worker) or Washroom Operatives (cleaners).</p><p>Everyone seems to crave a badge of honour to prove their worth to the world.</p><p><em>Whoop dee fucking do.</em></p><p>Why bother? A badge changes nothing. A new title is meaningless. Because you still won’t have respect.</p><p>Your colleagues and peers will only respect you if you work hard. They will only respect you if you <em>earn</em> your badge.</p><blockquote>The world only takes notice if your output makes a difference.</blockquote></div></div><div><div><h3>In The Startup World, Titles Mean Nothing.</h3><p>If you start your own business, you are either everything, <em>or nothing</em>.</p><p>I work as half of a two man team and that leaves a lot of ground to cover. Below is a list of job roles, or titles, I do or take control of in my startup.</p><ul><li>Founder</li><li>Designer</li><li>Maker</li><li>On Site Installations</li><li>Admin</li><li>Financial Management</li><li>Social Media Management</li><li>Email Management</li><li>Client Relations</li><li>Viewing and Assessing Jobs</li><li>Pricing and Costing</li><li>Producing Quotes and Invoices</li><li>Securing Commissions / Contracts</li><li>Website Development and Maintenance</li><li>Marketing Strategy</li><li>Design and Production of Marketing Materials</li><li>All Other PR</li></ul><figure></figure><blockquote><strong>Or to put that under one, easier to understand title… I am an entrepreneur.</strong></blockquote><p>And I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p></div></div><div><div><h3>The Startup Learning Curve</h3><p>When people ask<em> “what is the most rewarding thing about starting a business”,</em> I always give the same answer.</p><blockquote>The experiences and lessons learned in my startup journey have changed me forever.</blockquote><p>The learning curve has been (<em>is still</em>) huge, but it has been by far the biggest gain. Every single day has presented new problems. Every new project brings fresh challenges to take on. And with every one that you achieve, you get better and better as person, and more confident in a variety of roles.</p><p>Seriously, my personal development, skill set, abilities and life experience have all increased ten fold.</p><p>They have developed so much because I made the choice to take on all the roles mentioned above.</p><blockquote><strong><em>We made it our mission to learn to do them ourselves.</em></strong></blockquote><p>We didn’t want to hire people to manage our money.</p><p>We didn’t want to hire people to run our social media accounts.</p><p>We didn’t want to send reps down to meet clients on site.</p><p>We didn’t want to hire a web developer.</p><p>We didn’t want to pay for a graphic designer to do our marketing material.</p><blockquote>We wanted to develop a brand that was personal and relatable, a brand that allowed us to form genuine relationships with clients and customers. And we wanted to take control of this process.</blockquote><p>We chose to make our startup a tool to learn from.</p><p>We always agreed that even if it failed, as long as we gained great experience and a worthy portfolio from it, as long as we could tailor our achievements to get us jobs further down the line — it would be a success.</p></div></div><div><div><h3>My Advice?</h3><p>In the early days, don’t look to spend all the money you have on staff, or to outsource various aspects of the business.</p><p>Don’t spunk your budget on a high end marketer, or an admin assistant, or whatever.</p><blockquote>My advice is to take on the roles yourself.</blockquote><p>Step out of your comfort zone. Go into the unknown. Use your startup journey as a tool to learn from, a tool to gain experience from that will set you apart from the rest.</p><p>There is no harm in trying right?</p><blockquote>If you get others to do all the work for you, when the dust settles, successful or not, you will have not have gained the maximum experience and learning from your startup.</blockquote><p>And this means that if you are left searching for a new job, or a new career path, where can you turn if you just wasted your last few years developing no new skills and experience?</p><p>Nowhere, thats where.</p><p>So forget titles. Forget being CEO, Manager, Head of Company Whatever.</p><p>Be the jack of all trades, master of most.</p><p>Focus on learning, and on challenging yourself to develop new skillsets. Become accomplished in as many different aspects of your business as you possibly can.</p><p><strong>Be an entrepreneur, and learn the shit out of it, because this will set you apart from the rest.</strong></p></div></div></div></div>',

Hello Games’ Sean Murray followed Sony’s news with a <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky">bit more color on Twitter.</a></p><p></p><p>The VR update is part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/no-mans-sky-beyond/">No Man’s Sky Beyond</a>, the development team’s latest extremely generous bundle of new content, doled out to existing players for free. No Man’s Sky’s virtual reality makeover will launch on PlayStation VR and Steam VR this summer.</p><p>The VR update will enhance the first-person perspective of the existing game, allowing players to steer a starship using their thruster, reach into a bag to fetch their multitool and wave to fellow players meandering around the vastness of space.</p><p>While we don’t know all of the details yet, that experience will dovetail nicely with the forthcoming feature cluster known as No Man’s Sky Online, “a radical new social and multiplayer experience” for the at times isolated space sim.</p><p>“No Man’s Sky Virtual Reality is not a separate mode, but the entire game brought to life in virtual reality,” Murray wrote in<a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2019/03/no-mans-sky-beyond-vr/"> a blog post</a>. According to Murray, the update will offer “a true VR experience rather than a port.”</p><p>You can get a glimpse of how this will look in a teaser video, though since much of it depicts normal gameplay, there’s plenty of surprise still in store. Assuming the game runs well enough, No Man’s Sky Virtual Reality will be a far cry from gimmicky VR games that lack true depth, offering one of the most expansive — if not <em>the</em> most expansive — VR experiences to date.</p><p>No Man’s Sky fans should still keep an eye out — there’s<a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1106541245084721152"> one more mystery announcement left</a> for the Beyond update, which is shaping up to make the No Man’s Sky world more epic than anyone who played the game at launch could ever have hoped for.</p><p>“By bringing full VR support, for free, to the millions of players already playing the game, No Man’s Sky will become perhaps the most-owned VR title when released,” Murray wrote.</p><p>“We are excited for that moment when millions of players will suddenly update and be able to set foot on their home planets and explore the intricate bases they have built in virtual reality for the first time.”</p></div></div>',

Last fall, when Careem raised a $200M tranche of funding, the business was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-careem-funding/mideast-ride-hailing-app-careem-raises-200-million-to-expand-expects-more-funds-idUSKCN1MS0EF">reported</a> to be valued at around $2BN.</p><p>The value of the transaction also looks to be a record for a Middle Eastern tech startup exit, as well as being among the largest for a ride-hailing M&amp;A globally. (China’s Didi shelled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/didi-confirms-it-has-acquired-99-in-brazil-to-expand-in-latin-america/">$600M+</a> for Brazilian ride-hailing startup 99 at the start of last year, valuing that LatAm regional business at around $1BN, for example.)</p><p>It’s also notable for Uber aggressively stepping on the gas in a market, rather than making another <a href="https://twitter.com/jonrussell/status/1110493592529731586">strategic retreat</a>, as it has in regions such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/25/gruber-official/">Southeast Asia</a>.</p><p>Commenting on the Uber-Careem acquisition in a statement, Uber CEO <a href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dara-khosrowshahi">Dara Khosrowshahi </a>said:</p><blockquote><p>This is an important moment for Uber as we continue to expand the strength of our platform around the world. With a proven ability to develop innovative local solutions, Careem has played a key role in shaping the future of urban mobility across the Middle East, becoming one of the most successful startups in the region. Working closely with Careem’s founders, I’m confident we will deliver exceptional outcomes for riders, drivers, and cities, in this fast-moving part of the world.</p></blockquote><p>While Careem CEO and co-founder, Mudassir Sheikha had this to say in another supporting statement:</p><blockquote><p>Joining forces with Uber will help us accelerate Careem’s purpose of simplifying and improving the lives of people, and building an awesome organisation that inspires. The mobility and broader internet opportunity in the region is massive and untapped, and has the potential to leapfrog our region into the digital future. We could not have found a better partner than Uber under Dara’s leadership to realise this opportunity. This is a milestone moment for us and the region, and will serve as a catalyst for the region’s technology ecosystem by increasing the availability of resources for budding entrepreneurs from local and global investors.</p></blockquote><p>Upon closing, Careem will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Uber — and will continue to operate under its own brand, with Sheikha leading the Careem business.</p><p>Under Uber’s ownership Careem will report to its own board made up of three representatives from Uber and two representatives from Careem, Uber added.</p><p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Careem-co-founders-Magnus-Olsson-Mudassir-Sheikha-and-Abdulla-Elyas.jpg?w=680"></p><p>There is some overlap in regional market operation currently. So it remains to be seen whether both brands will continue to operate in cities such as Cairo or Casablanca indefinitely — or whether Careem might ultimately prevail as the selected brand for Middle Eastern and select Asian markets.</p><p>On this an Uber spokeswoman told us: “Nothing changes until the transaction is closed in Q1 2020 per regulatory approval. Following that, we will operate as two separate brands in all the markets we operate in.”</p><p>Initially it certainly sounds like there’s no plan to make major market changes, with Uber emphasizing that the pair <span>will operate their respective regional services as well as independent brands. </span>Though it’s possible that’s intended to try to reassure regulators that competition and innovation will not suffer from the merger. (Even if any branded difference will just be a mirage atop a merged business at the backend.)</p><p>Uber describes the acquisition as a marriage of its “global leadership and technical expertise with Careem’s regional technology infrastructure and proven ability to develop innovative local solutions”, <span>suggesting the acquisition will support enable the pair to offer “diverse mobility, delivery and payment options”, while bolstering regional transportation infrastructure “at scale”. </span></p><p>“It will speed up the delivery of digital services to people in the region through the development of a consumer-facing super-app that offers services such as Careem’s digital payment platform (Careem Pay) and last-mile delivery (Careem Now),” it further suggests.</p><p>Uber also claims the acquisition will support an expansion in the “variety and reliability” of services offered, touting a “broader range of price points” for ride-hailing consumers, while claiming that those driving for the two brands should expect an increase in trip growth and “improved services” which it says will support better work opportunities and “higher and more predictable earnings” by making better use of drivers’ time on the road.</p><p>Albeit, it would say that wouldn’t it. And certainly it remains to be seen how consolidation of two regional ride-hailing rivals will have a positive impact on — for example — consumer prices for such services in the region.</p><p>In a memo to Uber staff, obtained by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/26/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahis-email-to-staff-on-careem-acquisition.html">CNBC</a>, Khosrowshahi couches the move as a “big leap” for Uber, pointing to strong growth in markets such as Pakistan and other recent developments such as Saudi Arabia opening up to women drivers as putting wind in ride-hailing’s regional sails.</p><p>What’s not mentioned in the memo is the tougher regulatory regime Uber’s business faces in Western markets where a series of legal challenges and critical scrutiny from policymakers has forced changes in how it operates that increase costs for the business — such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/uber-expands-its-accident-insurance-across-europe/">free insurance for drivers and delivery couriers which Uber expanded across Europe</a> last year.</p><p>It’s also been moved to diversify from ride-hailing to planning for a multi-modal mix that includes micro-mobility services (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/uber-acquires-bike-share-startup-jump/">acquiring e-bike startup Jump last year</a>) as cities toughen policies towards congestion and pollution, and young urban consumers in temperate climates seek out hip alternatives to calling a car to get around.</p><p>By contrast the oil rich Middle East, with ‘lighter touch’ regulation and blistering temperatures which naturally favor air conditioned transportation, is arguably as close as it gets to perfect market conditions for ride-hailing generally, and therefore perhaps offers a more reliable demand base for Uber, a business that’s still got cars at its core.</p><p>On the structural decision to allow Careem to maintain an independent brand and operate separately, Khosrowshahi writes in the memo to staff that this was chosen after “careful consideration”.</p><p>“[W]e decided that this framework has the advantage of letting us build new products and try new ideas across not one, but two, strong brands, with strong operators within each. Over time, by integrating parts of our networks, we can operate more efficiently, achieve even lower wait times, expand new products like high-capacity vehicles and payments, and quicken the already remarkable pace of innovation in the region,” he suggests, adding that he expects “very little” to change in either teams’ day-to-day operations post-close as both companies will “continue to largely operate separately after the acquisition”.</p><p>The decision to operate both brands was also the strategy used when China’s Didi Chuxing agreed to buy Uber’s China business, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/?_ga=2.225309466.1494897808.1553444687-1757155993.1533833482">2016</a>.</p><p>Another element here is Uber’s long trailed IPO — which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/14/uber-will-reportedly-file-for-ipo-next-month/">reported</a> to be finally, finally happening next month.</p><p>Bagging Careem now offers Uber some fuel for the growth story it will want to be able to pitch to potential shareholders ahead of going public — as a counter-narrative to offset the stiff losses its business continues to incur every quarter, even as it’s having to shell out $1.4BN in cash to bring Careem into the fold.</p><p>Most recently Uber reported $3BN in Q4 2018 revenues with net losses of $865M — the latter aided by a tax benefit that saved it from reporting a $1.2BN net loss in the period.</p><p>While on an annual basis, its revenues came in at $3BN for 2018 and losses totalled $1.8BN vs $2.2BN in 2017, so it’s shrinking the gap at least.</p></div></div>',

      html: '<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple">Apple’s </a>new credit card has a curious security feature that will make it much more difficult to carry out credit card fraud.</p><p>The aptly named Apple Card is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/introducing-apple-card-a-new-kind-of-credit-card-created-by-apple/">a new credit card</a>, built into your iPhone Wallet app, which the company says will help customers live a “healthier” financial lifestyle. The card is designed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/25/apple-introduces-its-own-credit-card-the-apple-card/">replace your traditional credit card</a> and give you perks, such as daily cash. Chief among the benefits is a range of security and privacy features, which Apple says — unlike traditional credit card providers — the company doesn’t know where a customer shopped, what they bought or how much they paid.</p><p>But its one feature — a one-time unique dynamic security code — will make it nearly impossible for anyone to use the credit card to make fraudulent purchases.</p><p>That three-digit card verification value — or a CVV — on the back of your credit card is usually your last line of defense if someone steals your credit card number, such as if your card is cloned or skimmed by a dodgy ATM or stolen from a website through a phishing attack.</p><p>But rotating the security code will increase the difficulty for an attacker to use your card without your permission.</p><p>The idea of a dynamic credit card number first <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-number-changing-credit-card-may-help-eliminate-fraud/">came about a few years ago</a> with the Motion Code credit card concept, built by Oberthur Technologies, which included a randomly generating number built into a tiny display on the back of the card. The only downside is if someone steals your physical card.</p><p>Since then, other credit card makers — including Mastercard, the issuing payment provider for Apple Card — have worked to integrate biometric solutions instead. By enabling a fingerprint sensor on the card, powered by the card machine it was entered into, it was hoped that fraudulent purchases would be impossible. Other credit cards have worked to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gemalto-launches-new-contactless-credit-card-secured-by-biometrics/">roll out biometric-powered credit cards</a>. Again — a big letdown was online fraud, which still accounts for a huge proportion of fraud.</p><p>Apple Card seems to meld the two things: a virtual credit card with a rotating security code, protected by a biometric, like Touch ID or Face ID in newer devices. Better yet, the company’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/introducing-apple-card-a-new-kind-of-credit-card-created-by-apple/">debut physical titanium credit card</a> won’t even have a credit card number.</p><p>Now if someone wants to commit fraud, they need to steal your phone and your face or fingerprint.</p><p>Like other sensitive data — such as health, financial and biometric data — any banking and credit card data is stored on the device’s security chip, known as the secure enclave.</p><p>Apple Card will be available in the U.S. later this summer.</p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-media-event-2019"><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/apple-event-2019-march-banner1.png"></a></p></div></div>',

From working 3 jobs in high school, to selling on Etsy&nbsp;today, I\'ve been able to build up secondary income streams in a variety of ways. When I tell people about my pursuits in <a href=\\"https://www.inc.com/arianna-odell/heres-how-you-can-start-a-side-business-in-10-minutes-per-day.html\\">passive income and side hustling</a>, I\'m met with a barrage of questions. Here are the most common that can help you overcome your hesitations and get started today:&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>1.&nbsp;How can I get started?</h2>\\r\\n<p>I\'ve always loved making gifts for friends and always thought there was need in the market for funny quirky gifts when I was shopping. I began creating my own products for fun and to my surprise others wanted them too.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>There are so many ways you can get started with a side hustle. Whether you pick up a second job for the weekends, or sell a product to consumers, there are many ways to generate additional income streams.</p>\\r\\n<p>To get started, think about a skill that you have that provides value to others and see how you can turn it into a business. Are you an amazing pie maker? Sell pies to those in your community. Do you know how to code? On the weekends, use your skills to build websites for clients. The first step in side hustling is to take a step back to see what you\'re good at. Then you can figure out a way to monetize it.</p>\\r\\n<h2>2. What about taxes and licenses?&nbsp;</h2>\\r\\n<p>Taxes can be intimidating and prevent new entrepreneurs&nbsp;from ever getting started with their side hustle. Though I don\'t have a background in business logistics, I learned everything I needed to know about taxes and licensing from Google searches and talking to seasoned enraptures.</p>\\r\\n<p>It might feel scary to wade into uncharted regulatory&nbsp;waters,&nbsp;you can find many digestible articles online that can help you break down the legalities of running a business. And you\'d be surprised how easy it is to get started. In most states, you can form a sole proprietorship&nbsp;for around $50 or register an LLC for around $200.</p>\\r\\n<p>While I did all of this myself, if you\'re still feeling hesitant about starting a business, a tax professional and consultant can often get you on the right track when you\'re just starting off.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>3. What are some easy side hustles to start?&nbsp;</h2>\\r\\n<p>Some common side hustles that are easy to start including, writing, website creation, social media management, teaching a language, and selling products online. For my side hustle, I use print-on demand technology to sell a wide range of products from yoga mats to t-shirts.</p>\\r\\n<p>Think about a skill that would benefit others or an activity you love doing. Then you can work backwards to think about what kinds of people would pay for the service and how it could provide value to others. From writing eBooks, to showing others how to organize, there are many ways you can turn your expertise into education that people would gladly pay for.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>4. How can I find the time?</h2>\\r\\n<p>You don\'t need an entire day of the week to get started with side hustling. In fact, you can get started in as little as 10 minutes a day.

From working 3 jobs in high school, to selling on Etsy&amp;nbsp;today, I&apos;ve been able to build up secondary income streams in a variety of ways. When I tell people about my pursuits in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/arianna-odell/heres-how-you-can-start-a-side-business-in-10-minutes-per-day.html&quot;&gt;passive income and side hustling&lt;/a&gt;, I&apos;m met with a barrage of questions. Here are the most common that can help you overcome your hesitations and get started today:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;h2&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;How can I get started?&lt;/h2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve always loved making gifts for friends and always thought there was need in the market for funny quirky gifts when I was shopping. I began creating my own products for fun and to my surprise others wanted them too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;There are so many ways you can get started with a side hustle. Whether you pick up a second job for the weekends, or sell a product to consumers, there are many ways to generate additional income streams.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;To get started, think about a skill that you have that provides value to others and see how you can turn it into a business. Are you an amazing pie maker? Sell pies to those in your community. Do you know how to code? On the weekends, use your skills to build websites for clients. The first step in side hustling is to take a step back to see what you&apos;re good at. Then you can figure out a way to monetize it.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;h2&gt;2. What about taxes and licenses?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;Taxes can be intimidating and prevent new entrepreneurs&amp;nbsp;from ever getting started with their side hustle. Though I don&apos;t have a background in business logistics, I learned everything I needed to know about taxes and licensing from Google searches and talking to seasoned enraptures.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;It might feel scary to wade into uncharted regulatory&amp;nbsp;waters,&amp;nbsp;you can find many digestible articles online that can help you break down the legalities of running a business. And you&apos;d be surprised how easy it is to get started. In most states, you can form a sole proprietorship&amp;nbsp;for around $50 or register an LLC for around $200.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;While I did all of this myself, if you&apos;re still feeling hesitant about starting a business, a tax professional and consultant can often get you on the right track when you&apos;re just starting off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;h2&gt;3. What are some easy side hustles to start?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;Some common side hustles that are easy to start including, writing, website creation, social media management, teaching a language, and selling products online. For my side hustle, I use print-on demand technology to sell a wide range of products from yoga mats to t-shirts.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;Think about a skill that would benefit others or an activity you love doing. Then you can work backwards to think about what kinds of people would pay for the service and how it could provide value to others. From writing eBooks, to showing others how to organize, there are many ways you can turn your expertise into education that people would gladly pay for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;h2&gt;4. How can I find the time?&lt;/h2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t need an entire day of the week to get started with side hustling. In fact, you can get started in as little as 10 minutes a day. Simply starting small and building over time can help you create lucrative future income streams.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;For over two years, I worked on my store for 10-15 minutes a day when I was done with my client work. Now it&apos;s providing me a steady stream of income.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;If you have time to watch Netflix, you have time to start a business. Get started today and reap the benefits tomorrow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","adinfo":{"c_type":"article","showlogo":true,"cms":"inc226487","video":"no","aut":["arianna-odell"],"channelArray":{"topid":"40","topfilelocation":"strategy","primary":["grow","innovate","startup"],"primaryFilelocation":["grow","innovate","startup"],"primaryname":["Grow","Innovate","Startup"],"sub":["strategy","creativity","homebased"],"subFilelocation":["strategy","creativity","home-based-business"],"subname":["Strategy","Creativity","Home-Based Business"]},"adzone":"/4160/mv.inc/grow/strategy/strategy"},"seriesname":null,"editorname":null,"commentcount":null,"inc5000companies":[],"companies":[],"buyerzonewidgets":[],"photoEssaySlideModels":null,"custom_article_footer":null,"ser_footer_blurb":null,"dayssincepubdate":20,"trackingpixel":"","promotions":null,"inline_script_tags":[],"loadedFully":true,"promoimage":"https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_651138524_384024.jpg","largepromoimage":"https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1940x900/getty_651138524_384024.jpg","pubdate":"2019-02-22T09:51:44.000Z","author":"Arianna O\'Dell","authortwitter":"@arianna","articlesection":"Grow"},"server698193":{"id":227288,"inc_homepage_headline":"Is Your Perfectionism Killing Your Success?

Users could now choose up to 10 images to display, in precisely the order they want to display them. “Create a step-by-step cake recipe that people can always find on your profile,” the company suggested in its <a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2017/02/22/share-up-to-10-photos-and-videos-in-one-post/">announcement</a>.</p><p>Something has changed since then. Multi-photo posts will now often start on the second image in a series. These “photo nudges,” as I call them, seem to occur when you scroll past an image without engaging with it. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/how-instagram-feed-works/">Instagram’s algorithm</a>, growing smarter every day through the data users create, reinserts these series into your feed disguised as something new by “nudging” the second image forward. Whenever this happens, Instagram’s watching eye suddenly becomes a visible presence in my experience, and an annoying one at that.</p><p>Instagram did not return a request for comment about photo nudges, but a few design experts had some thoughts. As you’d expect, there’s a good chance the move is all about Instagram’s bottom line — and not your own experience with the app.</p><p>“It’s all in the pursuit of engagement, making sure that when you log in, you keep seeing posts that resonate with you,” says Kate Moran, a user experience specialist at Nielsen Norman Group. She adds that the feature might also “encourage and make sure that the posts that you submit are getting likes, so that you’re more motivated to keep posting in the future.”</p><p>Moran was quick to point out that she’s just speculating, but her point makes sense. “Presumably, people are probably organizing those multiple-photo posts in some sort of meaningful way,” she says, but Instagram prioritizes engagement and algorithmically sorts your timeline as is. Rearranging the images within a multi-photo post could be just another way to encourage interactions from viewers.</p><p>That theory, she says, helps explain other features, like notifications encouraging people to interact with posts from what the company defines as “at-risk users” — those who use and post to the app infrequently.</p><blockquote>“It’s all in the pursuit of engagement.”</blockquote><p>Frank Garofalo, principal consultant at Garofalo UX, also speculates that the second-photo feature could be a fix for users who are accustomed to vertical scrolling, but not necessarily the horizontal swiping required of multi-photo posts.</p><p>“If their analytics of usage was showing that, across the board, there was a low use of scrolling through multiple photos of a single post, this might be an attempt to try to increase those analytics and that actual usage count,” he says.</p><p>That begs another question: does the format even make much sense to begin with? Instagram is all about moving through a vertical space. Kevin P. Nichols, executive director of experience at AvenueCX, for one, says multi-photo posts disrupt user expectations.</p><p>“It’s mimicking the functionality of a carousel,” he says. “I think there’s better design approaches to do it than what we’re seeing here.”</p><p>Nichols suggests multi-photo posts displayed in single, gridded tile may be easier to interact with. A horizontal scroll for the feed could be another option that more naturally matches the multi-photo feature, though Instagram tested that in December — and immediately faced a user <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/technology/instagram-update-horizontal-scroll.html">revolt</a>.</p><p>In any case, the multi-photo feature signals a departure from Instagram’s initial functionality.</p><p>“The point of Instagram is you’re trying to showcase a particular image or idea or theme and then comment on it, so multi-photo posts kind of defeats that purpose and dilutes that purpose,” Nichols says.</p><p>So, the next time you’re alone absentmindedly thumbing through your feed while sitting on the couch or the toilet, you may come across an interesting photo only to swipe left and realize it’s a post you had seen before. In that moment of technological deja vu, remember that Instagram is always watching — and changing based on what you do.</p></div></div></div></div>',

Backed by roughly $40 million in venture capital, Omni proclaims on its website that they “<a href="https://www.beomni.com/about">believe in experiences over things</a>, access over ownership, and living lighter rather than being weighed down by our possessions.”</p><p>If you’re in the Bay Area, you can currently <a href="https://app.beomni.com/items/1afa5a51-fc24-42d8-b95e-d363f0e1e4d5">rent a copy</a> of<em> The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</em> by Marie Kondo from “Lan” for the low price of $1 per day; “charles” is <a href="https://app.beomni.com/items/fac61464-0dd5-4e32-9756-6933d10daa8f">renting a small framed lithograph</a> for $10 a day; and “Tom” is <a href="https://app.beomni.com/items/cc7f5b82-baaf-4ba1-9d15-4f6a62c0d893">renting a copy of the film</a> <em>Friends With Benefits</em> (68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) on Blu-ray for just $2 a day. Those prices don’t include delivery and return fees for the Omni trucks traversing the city, which <a href="https://www.beomni.com/pricing">start at $1.99</a> each way.</p><p>In 2016, Omni’s CEO and co-founder Tom McLeod <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/2016/08/10/san-francisco-startup-omni-wants-make-everything-part-sharing-economy/">said that</a> “lending enables Omni members to put their ‘dormant’ belongings to good use in their community.” That same year, <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/06/omni-envisions-true-sharing-economy/">Fortune said</a> Omni “could create a true ‘sharing economy.’” For a while, the tenets of the sharing economy were front and center in Omni’s model: It promised to activate underutilitized assets in order to sustain a healthier world and build community trust. In 2017, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/24/omni-rental/">McLeod said</a>, “We want to change behavior around ownership on the planet.”</p><p>Just three years later, those promises seem second to the pursuit of profit. In 2019, the Omni pitch can be summed up by the ads emblazoned on its delivery trucks: “Rent things from your neighbors, earn money when they rent from you!”</p><p>For years, the sharing economy was pitched as an altruistic form of capitalism — an answer to consumption run amok. Why own your own car or power tools or copies of <em>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</em> if each sat idle for most of its life? The sharing economy would let strangers around the world maximize the utility of every possession to the benefit of all.</p><blockquote>Sharing was supposed to transform our world for the better.</blockquote><p>In a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption/transcript">2010 TED Talk</a>, sharing economy champion and author Rachel Botsman argued that the tech-enabled <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption?language=en">sharing economy could</a> “mimic the ties that used to happen face to face but on a scale and in a way that has never been possible before.” Botsman quoted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/magazine/08Zipcar-t.html">a<em> New York</em> <em>Times</em> piece</a> in saying, “Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the eight track, what solar power is to the coal mine.” In 2013, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/opinion/sunday/friedman-welcome-to-the-sharing-economy.html">Thomas Friedman proclaimed</a> that Airbnb’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/04/trust-in-the-share-economy/">true innovation wasn’t</a> its platform or its distributed business model: “It’s ‘trust.’” At a 2014 conference, Uber investor Shervin Pishevar said sharing was going to bring us back to a mythical bygone era of low-impact, communal village living.</p><p>More than 10 years since the dawn of the sharing economy, these promises sound painfully out of date. Why rent a DVD from your neighbor, or own a DVD at all, when you can stream your movies online? Why use Airbnb for a single room in your home when you can sublease an entire apartment and run a lucrative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/nyregion/airbnb-illegal-brokers-real-estate.html">off-the-books hotel operation</a>? Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb — startups that banked on the promises of the sharing economy — are now worth tens of billions, with plans go public. (Lyft filed for an IPO on March 1.) These companies and the pundits who hyped them have all but abandoned the sharing argument that gave this industry life and allowed it to skirt government regulations for years. Sharing was supposed to transform our world for the better. Instead, the only thing we’re sharing is the mess it left behind.</p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9f3cshm-M1al7vIiMsnlZA.png"></span><span>T</span></span>he first glimpses of the sharing economy emerged years before the term came into popular use. In 1995, Craigslist mainstreamed the direct donation, renting, and sale of everything from pets and furniture to apartments and homes. Starting in 2000, Zipcar let members rent cars for everyday errands and short trips with the express goal of taking more cars off the road. And CouchSurfing, launched as a nonprofit in 2004, suddenly turned every living room into a hostel. This first wave of sharing was eclectic and sometimes even profitable, but before the mass adoption of the smartphone, it failed to capture the public’s imagination.</p><p>Though its origin is vague, many credit the introduction of the term “sharing economy” into the broader tech lexicon to Lawrence Lessig, who wrote about sharing in his 2008 book <em>Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy</em>. The Great Recession was just setting in, and the sharing economy was touted as a new DIY social safety net/business model hybrid. The contours of the term were never particularly clear. It was used loosely to describe peer-to-peer projects and tech-enabled rental markets but also included old barter, co-op, and casual carpooling models. The sharing economy was a broad, eclectic movement with ambitious if utopian goals. The <a href="https://www.shareable.net/about">online magazine Shareable</a> launched in 2009 to document this “movement of movements.”</p><blockquote>Sharing would be the instrument by which we’d be able to know one another again, a counterbalance to the alienation of a burgeoning tech dystopia.</blockquote><p>Sharing would help reduce overconsumption and our impact on the environment. Venture capitalist and tech trend spotter <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/12/mary-meeker-possessions/">Mary Meeker said</a> Americans were moving from an “asset-heavy lifestyle to an asset-light existence” with the sharing economy leading the charge. Environment and politics researcher <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e91/16758a648724c637597825af1065a8c50dbe.pdf">Harald Heinrichs suggested</a> the sharing economy was a “potential new pathway to sustainability.” Greenpeace’s <a href="https://storyofstuff.org/blog/its-time-to-replace-more-with-better-2/">Annie Leonard</a> framed sharing in <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/the-human-cost-of-stuff/annie-leonard-more-than-a-mindful-consumer">opposition to consuming</a>: The sharing economy, she wrote, would “conserve resources, give people access to stuff they otherwise couldn’t afford, and build community.”</p><p>Sharing also promised social benefits. It would be the instrument by which we’d be able to know one another again, a counterbalance to the alienation of a burgeoning tech dystopia. <a href="https://www.harrywalker.com/speakers/april-rinne">Sharing economy expert</a> April Rinne said sharing would recreate the social fabric of tight-knit communities. “Engaging in collaborative consumption — and getting used to it — lowers the trust barrier over time,” <a href="http://www.shareable.net/blog/lessons-from-microfinance-for-the-sharing-economy">she wrote</a> at Shareable. New <a href="https://twitter.com/trustcloud">startups like TrustCloud</a> would gather all of our disparate platform ratings and social trails from across the web and compile them into a new kind of social credit score that would enable <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trustcloud">trust and accountability</a> in the sharing economy.</p><p>The new opportunities to earn money by freelancing part-time as a handyman, innkeeper, or taxi driver would bridge the wealth gap and ameliorate global inequality. In 2013, CNN contributor <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/01/08/opinion/jones-share-economy/index.html">Van Jones said</a> that sharing could lead us to “a more sustainable, prosperous future.”</p><p>Adam Werbach was president of the Sierra Club and a corporate sustainability consultant before he co-founded the used goods sharing marketplace Yerdle in 2012. A sort of proto-Omni, Yerdle’s original tagline was, “Stop buying. Start sharing.” The site incentivized renters to rent their own things by rewarding them with credits and keeping used goods recycling in the Yerdle community.</p><p>“There was a mix of venture-backed companies, social-benefit companies, and nonprofits all in the space, all fighting for it. And all of the companies were small, and all the founders hung out — it was a community,” Werbach says of those heady early times. “I had hoped this would be the taming of capitalism.”</p><p>Janelle Orsi, attorney, co-founder, and executive director of the Sustainable Economies Law Center, used to call herself a sharing lawyer, which, she says now, “a lot of people thought was a joke.” Orsi helped set up small workers cooperatives and worked on cottage food legislation to make it possible for people in California to sell food they cooked at home on a small scale both on and off digital platforms.</p><p>For Orsi, the sharing pitch had some value in selling an idea that was uncomfortable at the time. “It took a certain kind of community-oriented person willing to take a risk and book an Airbnb or get in an Uber early on,” says Orsi. For her, and likely for many of the early sharing adopters, truly cleaner, lighter living through platform technology was seductive and incredibly promising. But that innocence was short-lived.</p><p>“I had a very grassroots community-based vision of it,” she says. “And then all of a sudden, here comes the big tech companies. It was totally hijacked.”</p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K1m8OQ0CwvfyECYZb4z6hw.png"></span><span>P</span></span>erhaps no company is as emblematic of the sharing economy sector and its rapid evolution as Lyft. Zimride, Lyft’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3555783&amp;page=1">original parent company</a>, was a service that focused on college campuses and long-distance rides in areas with few other transit options. Co-founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/6000-words-about-a-pink-mustache/">Logan Green told reporters</a> he was inspired by the slow grind of Los Angeles traffic, thick with single-occupant cars. If he could find a way to entice more people to carpool, Green reasoned, there would be less traffic on the road.</p><p>In 2012, Zimride launched Lyft to service shorter rides in cities. Lyft advertised “<a href="http://get.lyft.com/download/x.html">friendly rides</a>,” encouraging passengers to sit up front alongside the driver and pay a suggested donation if they felt like it. The <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/How-ride-share-services-skirt-taxi-rules-3835566.php">company argued</a> that because the platform only acted to connect riders and drivers, with payment optional, it couldn’t be regulated as a taxi service provider. But just a year after it was spun out, Lyft instituted set ride fares and had already raised $83 million in financing. It was a sharing economy success story: In 2015, Lyft was recognized by the <a href="https://thecirculars.org/our-finalists/filter/eyJyZXN1bHRfcGFnZSI6Im91ci1maW5hbGlzdHNcL2ZpbHRlciIsInNlYXJjaDpjc195ZWFyIjoiMjAxNSJ9">Circulars economy awards</a> at Davos for “helping to decongest roads.”</p><blockquote>Seemingly everything was a part of this new economy.</blockquote><p>Over the first half of the 2010s<strong>, </strong>the so-called sharing economy evolved into a powerful new multibillion-dollar economic model. At about the same time, the definition of “sharing” began to shift. Sharing still referred to the peer-to-peer model of leveraging underutilized assets — sharing our goods with each other — but it was also increasingly applied to more traditional centralized rental models.</p><p>Seemingly everything was a part of this new economy: bike-sharing sponsored by multinational banks, apps that allowed people to rent parking spaces on public streets, and platforms that allowed for the peer-to-peer sale of used clothes. Sharing was the donor-funded nonprofit Wikipedia, and it was the massive unicorn <a href="https://www.inc.com/linkedin/sramana-mitra/billion-dollar-unicorn-wework-riding-sharing-economy-wave-mitra.html">WeWork</a>. When the Avis Budget Group bought short-term car-rental service ZipCar in 2013, investor <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/commentary-the-sharing-economy-is-no-passing-fad/2013/01/18/ed706e50-5e8c-11e2-9940-6fc488f3fecd_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.360d9b02ff6e">Steve Case said</a> it was an indicator of the sharing economy’s growing potential. “Sharing is not a passing fad,” he wrote in the<em> Washington Post</em>. “Fasten your seatbelts: It’s just the beginning.”</p><p>Even though the term “sharing” was quickly being drained of any meaning, industry insiders still touted its social benefits. In 2014, Airbnb global head of community Douglas Atkin told <a href="https://medium.com/the-nib/the-case-against-sharing-9ea5ba3d216d">a sharing economy conference</a>, “The sharing economy deserves to succeed. There’s a decentralization of wealth and control and power. That’s why this economy is a better economy.”</p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PwSYqNtjY92pj55o9Q1dOg.png"></span><span>By</span></span> the mid-2010s, the narrative around the innovative, cure-all sharing economy had started to sour. As platforms banking on “collaborative consumption” edged toward multibillion-dollar valuations, sharing began to feel naive.</p><p>“I sort of observed the shift happening beginning in 2016,” says labor attorney Veena Dubal, who was working with freelance taxi drivers in San Francisco before sharing hit the road. “There was a moment of novelty but then a realization that these were the same things. Just much cheaper and unregulated.”</p><p>Three years ago, in a piece co-authored with entrepreneur and model <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/19/lily-cole-impossible-social-network-gift-economy">Lily Cole</a>, Adam Werbach also <a href="https://medium.com/impossible/sharing-has-been-hijacked-b8d90c7cf55b">suggested that corporations</a> had hijacked sharing. “Whilst modern rental platforms offer enormous value… they do not reflect the sentiment of sharing that has defined communities as communities for thousands of years.” They offered another word instead: rent.</p><blockquote>What came next wasn’t sharing. Power and control wasn’t decentralized — it was even more concentrated in the hands of large and valuable platforms.</blockquote><p>In some instances, the sharing economy appeared to inflame the very problems it purported to solve. The supposed activation of underutilized resources actually led to more, if slightly different, patterns of resource consumption. A number of studies have shown that the ease and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uber-valued-at-62-billion-still-loses-money-on-its-rides/">subsidized low cost</a> of Uber and Lyft rides are <a href="http://www.schallerconsult.com/rideservices/automobility.htm">increasing traffic</a> <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/02/25/studies-show-uber-lyft-make-cities-traffic-congestion-worse/">in cities</a> and apparently <a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/01/uber-lyft-ride-hailing-impact-public-transit-ridership/581062/">pulls passengers</a> away from an actual form of sharing: public transportation. Students at UCLA are reportedly taking roughly <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2019/01/29/popularity-of-brief-uber-lyft-rides-on-campus-raises-environmental-concerns/">11,000 rides</a> each week that never even leave campus.<strong> </strong>In putting more cars on the road, ride-hail companies have encouraged would-be drivers to consume more by <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/5-ways-car-uber-lyft/">buying cars</a> with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/8/16112498/uber-phase-out-xchange-car-leasing-losses">subprime loans</a> or <a href="https://www.lyft.com/expressdrive">renting</a> directly from the platforms themselves.</p><p>Alongside making it easy to rent out spare rooms, vacation rental platforms encouraged speculative real estate investment. Whole homes and apartment buildings are taken off the rental market to act as hotels, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172946/airbnb-new-orleans-housing-crisis-gentrification-str">further</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/31/airbnb-sharing-economy-cities-barcelona-inequality-locals">squeezing</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/nov/29/empty-dublin-housing-crisis-airbnb-homelessness-landlords">housing</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/nyregion/new-york-city-airbnb-crackdown.html">markets</a> in already unaffordable cities.</p></div><div><p>Early sharing champions were ultimately correct about technology enabling a shift away from an ownership society, but what came next wasn’t sharing. The rise of streaming services, subscription systems, and short-term rentals eclipsed the promise of nonmonetary resource sharing. The power and control wasn’t decentralized; it was even more concentrated in the hands of large and valuable platforms.</p><p>Why go through the trouble of swapping your own DVDs for a copy of <em>Friends With Benefits</em>, after all, when you can stream it through Amazon Prime Video for $2.99? The idea of paying for temporary access to albums rather than outright owning them may have been galling at first, but we’re increasingly comfortable with renting all our music, along with our software, and our books. Downloading and sharing the materials that live on these streamed resources is impossible, illegal, or both.</p><p>The new trust never materialized. Government regulation typically plays an important role in mediating consumer relationships with corporate firms and for good reason. Peer-to-peer platforms can <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/uber-lyft-and-the-false-promise-of-fair-rides/506000/">make</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/travel/airbnb-discrimination-lawsuit.html">discrimination</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384600/uber-lyft-wheelchair-accessible-fail-nyc-report">easier</a>, and they often claimed limited or zero liability when things <a href="https://medium.com/matter/living-and-dying-on-airbnb-6bff8d600c04">went wrong</a>. New social media reputation tools couldn’t prevent inevitable problems, especially when sharing companies did not institute background checks for their freelance workers or inspect homes and vehicles for safety.</p><p>Sharing didn’t deliver broad financial stability either. The jobs eventually created by the sharing economy were poorly regulated and hastened the broader growth of contract labor, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/the-gig-economy-is-endangering-wages-economists-say-20180306-p4z329.html">pushing down already low wages</a> for freelancers and employees alike. A few frequently quoted studies have claimed that soon, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/press/2017/10/17/freelancing-in-america-2017/">most of us will be freelancers</a>. But most of <a href="https://www.apnews.com/dee67b607a034699abf4ec14bab5cb1c">that freelance work</a> appears to be extremely part-time and merely supplemental income, and ride-hail <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/01/22/uber-study-workforce/#7e90fc83367a">driver turnover</a> in particular is high.</p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9UGbUtX6-jzLNpmxJO5Oqg.png"></span><span>S</span></span>haring doesn’t have the positive market power it wielded 10 years ago. Since 2016, tech entrepreneurs and their promoters in the press seem to have largely ditched the language of sharing. It’s now about “platforms,” “on-demand services,” or, most recently, “the gig economy.”</p><p>Labor attorney Dubal is not thrilled with the new “gig” language either. The term may seem honest — it places the precarious nature of the contract labor front and center — but it doesn’t assuage broader structural concerns. “Even people who’ve stopped using the ‘sharing economy’ haven’t necessarily seen the light in terms of what kinds of work the company has propagated more broadly,” Dubal says. “They’ve<strong> </strong>normalized unregulated business.”</p><p>Some of sharing’s earliest, most outspoken champions have distanced themselves from the term. <a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/07/31/the_sharing_economy_gets_greedy/">Originally launched</a> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3019641/the-sharing-economy-is-owned-by-the-same-people-as-the-rest-of-the-economy">in 2013 as</a> “a grassroots organization to support the sharing economy movement,” the nonprofit Peers purported to “grow, mainstream, and protect the sharing economy,” essentially acting as a corporate lobby firm for sharing, on-demand, and gig startups. Peers’ partners included Lyft, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Getaround, and dozens of other mostly for-profit companies. The organization said the bulk of its funding <a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/08/02/who_owns_the_sharing_economy/">came from</a> “mission-aligned independent donors” and foundations, but it also had <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3022974/is-peers-the-sharing-economys-future-or-just-a-great-silicon-valley-pr-stunt">investment from Airbnb</a>.</p><p>By 2016, Peers had pivoted to <a href="https://wtfeconomy.com/friends-with-portable-benefits-shaping-a-new-system-with-lessons-from-existing-models-d5d36f531a8d">portable benefits</a> — an infrastructure to sustain gig workers as they labored without an employment safety net. Peers became “an organization for people working in new ways,” and it <a href="https://medium.com/@nataliefoster/peers-is-joining-the-indy-worker-guild-ed24655d8e9">merged with the newly created</a> Indy Worker Guild. Peers co-founder <a href="https://medium.com/@nataliefoster">Natalie Foster</a> went on to <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/who-we-are/">co-found the Economic Security Project</a>, which lobbies for a new solution to help struggling gig workers and job-havers alike: universal basic income.</p><blockquote>It’s now about “platforms,” “on-demand services,” or, most recently, “the gig economy.”</blockquote><p>In 2018, April Rinne, who previously pushed the sharing economy’s promise of a “tighter social fabric,” <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/the-dark-side-of-the-sharing-economy/">acknowledged “the dark side”</a> of the sharing economy but wrote that “the challenges faced by the sharing economy today are largely a result of its success.” Rachel Botsman, who argued that sharing would allow us to trust one another again, now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/dawn-of-the-techlash">writes about how technology</a> and the concentration of power on large centralized platforms has led to<strong> </strong>“an erosion of trust.”</p><p>The demand for Botsman’s mythical community-shared power drill never seemed to materialize. Neighborly goods-sharing platforms Crowd Rent, ThingLoop, and SnapGoods are all many years dead, and meal-sharing Josephine ended long ago. CouchSurfing has gone for-profit, with venture capital investment.</p><p>It turns out sharing “is not really a mass-market idea, which is sort of depressing,” says Werbach, who’s pivoted Yerdle into a logistics firm for large brands interested in re-selling their used goods. “Kindergarten teachers are interested in that, but consumers are really interested in what’s in it for them.”</p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9UGbUtX6-jzLNpmxJO5Oqg.png"></span><span>S</span></span>ome of the early, true sharing believers have decamped for the growing platform cooperative movement. “Now there’s a <a href="https://platform.coop/">whole consortium</a> of platform cooperatives,” says Orsi of the Sustainable Economies Law Center.</p><p>And these companies don’t bank on sharing. Organizations like <a href="https://loconomics.com/">Loconomics</a>, <a href="https://fairbnb.coop/">Fairbnb</a>, and <a href="https://www.stocksy.com/">Stocksy</a> see their efforts at cooperative consumption and production less as altruism and more as collectively owning the means of production.</p><p>Sharing tapped into economic anxiety, isolation, and frustration with contemporary U.S. middle-class life in a unique and ultimately profitable way. It was another iteration of Silicon Valley’s excruciating trope of changing the world by way of disruption, wrapped in a soft packaging of eco-friendly, feel-good liberalism. We were encouraged to give companies like Lyft and Airbnb a chance, to <a href="https://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-care-and-feeding-of-tech-boom">nurture them</a> and help them along for the greater good. If we didn’t believe in sharing, we weren’t just cynics but enemies of progress.</p><p>Many of the corporations and the pundits who sold us on the promises of sharing stopped using the term because consumers no longer found it believable or attractive. But it was consumers who really did sharing in. A true sharing economy is full of friction and discomfort, and the margins — if there are any to speak of — are paper thin. Real sharing is time-consuming and not particularly profitable for anyone.</p><blockquote>“Now it’s just a transaction. It doesn’t need to be dressed up in any language about changing the world or whatever.”</blockquote><p>In order to make money, especially the kind of money that tech investors expect, venture-backed companies couldn’t just activate underutilized resources — they had to make more. For-profit businesses demand growth, and platforms demand scale. More than a decade into the sharing experiment, we’ve been able to fully assess the costs. Capitalism wasn’t tamed, as Werbach had hoped — it was stoked.</p><p>“Now it’s just a transaction,” Werbach says. “It doesn’t need to be dressed up in any language about changing the world or whatever.”</p><p>And though sharing is largely dead, other tech-driven models have taken its place: VC-backed enterprises that still skate on the promise of <a href="https://psmag.com/environment/basically-its-an-app-that-keeps-poor-people-poor-the-vcs-will-love-it">solving inequality</a>, <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/fintech_for_the_financially_excluded">promoting justice</a>, <a href="https://www.affirm.com/business/company/">fixing broken systems</a>, and doing what regulators and big, old businesses have failed to do for decades.</p><p>These days, it’s not a shared drill that’s redefining trust and supplanting institutional intermediaries; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-blockchain-is-redefining-trust/">it’s the blockchain</a>. Botsman now says that the blockchain is the next step in shifting trust from institutions to strangers. “Even though most people barely know what the blockchain is, a decade or so from now, it will be like the internet,” she writes. “We’ll wonder how society ever functioned without it.”</p><p>The ambitious promises all sound very familiar.</p></div></div></div></div>',

Many of us spend our days hopping between messaging apps, from iMessage to WhatsApp to Facebook Messenger to Instagram and back again, carrying on fractured conversations with the same set of people across a number of platforms.</p><p>But many of those services are owned by a single company: Facebook. WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/1/16959804/whatsapp-facebook-biggest-messenger-instagram-users">collectively reach more than 2 billion people</a>, making Facebook the owner of the world’s largest messaging platform — and a potential gold mine.</p><p>Facebook knows this, and sensing the opportunity to completely own modern messaging, reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger.html">plans to unify those messaging services into a single, connected platform</a>. This would bring an obvious benefit to users — convenience — but I’m not convinced that merging these platforms is really about users’ needs at all. In all likelihood, this is about Facebook knowing more about its users, regardless of where they’re chatting, for the sake of its ad business.</p><h4><strong>Removing Walls</strong></h4><p>You could imagine Facebook’s products today as a series of silos. Instagram and WhatsApp have their own databases and <a href="https://qz.com/1525661/your-digital-identity-has-three-layers-and-you-can-only-protect-one-of-them/">identity layers</a> separate from the core social network. Users must create a login for each distinct network, which creates a fresh “identity” in the respective app’s database–even if a user logs in to Instagram using the Facebook login feature, because each service uses its own separate database infrastructure. In other words, all of these platforms are effectively distinct from one another despite sharing some common functionality.</p><figure></figure><p>The problem with this is obvious: It’s difficult for Facebook to get a complete picture of your habits, who you talk to, and what you’re talking about. Facebook does correlate some data between the services — like phone numbers — but they remain largely siloed from one another.</p><p>That’s a problem for Facebook, because the company relies on advertising for almost all of its revenue. (Last week, Facebook <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2019/Q1/Q1-19-Press-Release.pdf">announced</a> that it had made a little more than $15 billion in the first three months of 2019 alone, almost all of which came from ads.) As people <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/private-messages-new-social-networks/">use the broader social network less, in favor of private messaging</a>, it’s harder for Facebook to understand their habits — particularly in the case of WhatsApp, which is currently encrypted and difficult to serve personalized ads on.</p><blockquote>A unified messaging platform would allow Facebook to paint a better picture of you, rather than forcing the company to tie together disconnected pieces of metadata.</blockquote><p>Facebook’s solution to this problem is likely to be unifying the identity layer across all of these apps — allowing WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger to recognize the one true “you” — and then creating common endpoints for the databases to connect with one another. Today, Facebook needs to correlate the data you provide to each app in order to target ads properly, which is prone to mistakes and inconsistency. Unifying this, and removing that process, would allow these apps to tap into one “ad profile” that understands everything about you, regardless of where that data actually lives. This would make it much easier for the company to data mine the people you interact with and general topics across conversations, regardless of where you’re having them, effectively building a mega-platform behind the scenes.</p><p>Thus, the unified messaging platform would allow Facebook to paint a better picture of you as a whole person, rather than forcing the company to tie together disconnected pieces of metadata like it does today. That’s incredibly appealing to advertisers, and exactly the kind of problem you need to solve when your model is suddenly pivoting from publicly shared data to private conversations.</p><p>It’s unlikely that Facebook will merge the messaging databases backing each app directly, largely because their feature sets are so varied. But by abstracting away the identity layer, the company would be able to keep better track of what you’re doing, even though your conversations would remain stored in separate databases.</p><figure></figure><p>The proposed changes would mean that the apps themselves become little more than brands you interact with. WhatsApp and Messenger might have distinct styles and icons, but beneath it all you’d really be interacting with one core service.</p><p>In that world, Facebook’s “product” would largely be an identity layer that happens to have a social network attached to it. And that identity layer would also be the unified lens that Facebook sees you through, providing the ability to serve relevant advertisements regardless of what app you’re interacting with.</p><h4><strong>Strange Messaging</strong></h4><p>It’s weird that Facebook would signal these changes so early. Merging the backends of these apps is a technical problem, and most companies would have quietly handled it in the background.</p><p>But Facebook might be worried about how this merger would be perceived. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/27/facebooks-plan-to-merge-messaging-services-ignites-antitrust-concerns.html">Regulators are already circling the social network</a> — and the notion of a unified messaging app isn’t exactly calming them down. Facebook is pushing on with work regardless, with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-instagram-messenger-whatsapp-merger-when-date-mark-zuckerberg-a8755901.html">preliminary efforts to bridge the platforms already underway</a>.</p><p>By positioning the unification of its platforms as a user-focused initiative largely focused on how people message one another, Facebook is able to deflect that negative attention. It’s building something users want, not some mega-platform to gain total control over the messaging space.</p><p>But make no mistake: Merging these apps will ensure Facebook has a more resilient — and possibly even larger — advertising business for years to come, as the effectiveness of its News Feed fades away.</p><p>Are we sure we’re willing to let Facebook become the de facto messaging platform? Will we be able to opt out? We’ve already allowed Mark Zuckerberg to control the largest, most influential social network in the world.
