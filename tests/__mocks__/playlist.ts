More often than not, applications that offer a service that revolves around location display a map on the screen to allow users a more interactive experience. To offer your own users the same experience in an iOS application developed in React Native, follow these steps!</p></div></div><div><div><h3>Step 1: Install Tools</h3><p>This tutorial will use the CocoaPods package manager for Xcode projects. To install CocoaPods, run:</p><p><code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code></p><h3>Step 2: Install Map Library</h3><p>In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run the following command:</p><p><code>npm install react-native-maps --save</code></p><p>This will allow you to make use of React Native maps, with support for Google Maps, if desired, in your application.</p><h3>Step 3: Create Podfile and Install Pods</h3><p>A Podfile allows you to easily list and install the different dependencies you’d like to utilize in your project, similar to a Gemfile in Ruby. Create a Podfile in the <code>ios/</code> folder of your React Native project and use the following sample to get you started:</p><figure></figure><p>Once your Podfile is created with the correct dependencies, replace <code>_YOUR_PROJECT_TARGET_</code> with your project name and head back to your terminal and navigate to the iOS directory of your project (where you had created your Podfile) and run the command<code>pod install</code>.</p><p>This command will install all pods and create a new <code>.xcworkspace</code> file that you can use to build your project in Xcode. Alternatively, kick off a build by moving back to your root directory and running<code>cd ..</code> to navigate back to your root directory and <code>react-native run-ios</code> to run your application.</p><h3>Step 4: Add Map</h3><p>Once your dependencies are all added, we are ready to add a map to your application! Add the following import statement to the top of the map component:</p><pre>import MapView from \'react-native-maps\';</pre><p>Add the following snippet to your render method to display a map with a fixed initial position:</p><figure></figure><p>You might notice that your map is nowhere to be found. This has to do with styling, so go ahead and add these static styles to be used in the view you are wrapping your container with:</p><figure></figure><p>These styles will set you up to incorporate the autocomplete component on the top of the screen. If it is not needed in your use case, feel free to stop here and simplify your style component to:</p><pre>const styles = StyleSheet.create({<br>  map: {<br>    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,<br>  },<br>});</pre><p>You might want to allow the displayed location to change. Maintaining map coordinates in state would allow you the flexibility of doing this:</p><figure></figure><p>After incorporating these bits and pieces, your component will look a lot like this:</p><figure></figure><p>Hopefully, your map loads successfully and navigates to an area in San Francisco!</p><h3>Step 5: Add Marker</h3><p>Markers allow users to visually pinpoint exactly where they are on the map. You may have noticed that our current map does not include such functionality, so let us go ahead and add one.</p><figure></figure><h3>Step 6: Install Places Autocomplete</h3><p>To allow users to interact more closely with the map, we want to use an autocomplete feature that takes an address and converts it to the coordinates needed to render the address on the map. Installing <code>react-native-google-places-autocomplete</code> will make this integration much easier.</p><p>To install, navigate back to your terminal and run in the root directory of your project: <code>npm install react-native-google-places-autocomplete --save</code>.</p><h3>Step 7: Add Autocomplete Component</h3><p>Now that we have React Native Places Autocomplete installed, let us add it to our map.</p><p>Add the following to your component:</p><figure></figure><p>Be sure to grab your <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key">Google Places API key</a> and add it to the <code>query</code> parameter of the component.</p><p>You will notice an input field at the top of your simulator screen — go ahead and begin typing an address and watch as suggestions will generate based on your input! The implementation above does not handle the address selection, but adding an onPress method would allow you to grab the selected address and pass it along as a parameter to the MapView rendering your map. This tweak will allow you to see the selected address rendered on the map.</p><p>That’s all it takes to incorporate Apple Maps into your application!</p></div></div></div>',

Let me explain.</p><p>Six months ago, our User Experience Research (UXR) team <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/tools-on-organizational-productivity/">presented some interesting research</a>. They had just completed a series of customer interviews with organizations from California to Singapore.</p><p>It was no surprise to see that users create forms for surveys, event registrations, online payments or email signups.</p><p>But our UXR team saw an unusual pattern. We used to think about forms as a way to collect data, but we discovered many customers were using the product to <em>act</em> on the data — to analyze and make sense of what it meant in their businesses.</p><p>These interviews reinforced that JotForm was a productivity tool; not just a way to make sign-up forms or payment sheets.</p><p>We could have high-fived each other and stopped there, but that’s not how we roll.

As McKeown explains in a <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/book/">short video</a>,</p><blockquote>“Success becomes a catalyst for failure, because it leads to what <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/five-stages-of-decline.html">Jim Collins</a> called ‘the undisciplined pursuit of more.’ The antidote to that problem is the disciplined pursuit of less, but better.”</blockquote><p>Now it’s time to narrow in on what matters most.

Listen to yourself, and the people you’re working so hard to serve.</p><blockquote>“When people have the chance to think,” McKeown says, “they can easily discern between what’s essential and what’s not… We need to develop a routine that enables that space to think. In a world where we have so much information, we need more time to think and process it, not less.”</blockquote><p>This smart advice applies to customer research as well.</p><p>As more people request features, offer (sometimes contradictory) feedback, and contact support teams, you need to set aside additional time to listen to your users — to thoroughly understand how they use your product and what they’re trying to accomplish.</p><p>The more success you achieve, the more you need to formalize your listening with dedicated user research and interviewing processes.</p><p>I’ll write more soon about our user research approach, but here are some initial questions to help you get started.</p><figure></figure><h3>Five questions that can uncover new opportunities</h3><p>Talk to your customers as often as possible. Listen closely. If you’re not sure how to probe beyond basic use cases and find hidden needs, ask people:</p><blockquote>1. What do you often struggle to do or accomplish?</blockquote><blockquote>2. Where in your workflow do you or your team often hit roadblocks or frustrations?</blockquote><blockquote>3.

What would make your work life easier — on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis?</blockquote><blockquote>5.

What needs and desires do you <em>actually</em> help people to fulfill?</p><p>That’s where you have the opportunity to become not just helpful, but truly essential.</p><p>Then, keep listening. Watch for even the “small” opportunities that keep popping up, and go deeper to help your customers experience, accomplish or learn even more.</p><p>Just like Slack, being customer-centric will help you to define a new market instead of battling it out in a large, well-defined space with clear incumbents.</p><p>Take JotForm.

      html: '<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The technology industry has, at least, for the past forty years, been something of a sausage-fest, with men dominating almost all tiers of the workplace. A new report from infosec industry group, the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/">(ISC)2</a>, shows that’s gradually changing. Not only are women representing a larger swathe of the cybersecurity workforce, they’re also accomplishing great things in leadership roles.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.isc2.org/research/women-in-cybersecurity">(ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study</a> shows that women comprise an estimated 24 percent of the cybersecurity workforce. While that’s far from an even (and ideal) 50-50 split, it’s certainly indicative of an upwards trend of more women joining the industry. For context, in 2017, women made up just 11 percent of the burgeoning cybersecurity sphere.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this study, while promising, has significantly changed the parameters of who is included in the sample by widening the professions eligible for inclusion. Previously, the group consisted solely of infosec professionals working in official cybersecurity professions. In the latest edition, the survey sample includes other IT/ICT workers who dedicate at least a quarter of their working time on cybersecurity-related responsibilities, even if it’s not their main job.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that the methodology for the latest iteration of the study has generated some discussion, highlighting the difficulty of pinning down the true figure of women in infosec. If anything can be gleaned from this report, it’s that women have been doing infosec for a lot longer, and a lot more often, than has been previously recognized.</p><h2>What is an infosec worker?</h2><p>Not everyone in infosec is necessarily a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">penetration tester</a>, and not everyone in infosec spends all their time sat dealing with security-related problems. It’s worth recognizing that this is a field that’s fundamentally multidisciplinary in nature, and people often wear multiple hats (all white, one hopes) while working in the same role.</p><p>You could be an instructor who trains office workers how to perform their jobs without exposing the business to any unnecessary security risks (like, for example, using random USB flash drives that you found on the street). Programmers could spend their time reviewing code in order to find security vulnerabilities before a potential adversary does. You could be a journalist working on a security beat, writing important analysis about industry trends.</p><p>When I mentioned I was working on this post, someone (quite rightfully) pointed out that the involvement of women in infosec is nothing new. Women have historically had an enlarged role when it comes to keeping and protecting business information, working in fields like archiving and library science. And that, it could be argued, isn’t too far removed from today’s digital roles.</p><p>The report also shows that women are increasingly taking up a leadership role in the infosec industry. According to the (ISC)2, some 28 percent of women who responded to the survey hold a C-level or executive role. In comparison, only 19 percent of men said the same.</p><p>Similarly, seven percent of female respondents hold the coveted Chief Technology Officer position, compared to just two percent of men. A further 18 percent of women have a job title of IT director, compared to 14 percent of men.</p><p>So, in short: there’s more women in information security. Not only that, but they’re climbing the highest echelons of the industry and attaining leadership roles. Of course, there’s a long way to go, but overall, this is extremely good news. You can find out more about the (ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study <a href="https://www.isc2.org/research/women-in-cybersecurity">here</a>.</p><h2>Meet the experts</h2><p>Of course, I don’t want to merely tell you about these accomplished women. I want you to follow them and see their accomplishments first-hand. While writing this piece, I reached out to my Twitter followers and asked what women in infosec they admired. The response overwhelming. Dozens of people got in touch, to the point where Twitter said (paraphrased): “<em>I see you’re getting a shitload of notifications. Want to set up some filters?</em>”</p><p>Obviously, this isn’t an exhaustive list. Not even close. There are hundreds of thousands of people working in infosec.

A new report from infosec industry group, the (ISC)2 , shows that’s gradually changing. Not only are women representing a larger swathe of the cybersecurity workforce, they’re also accomplishing great things in leadership roles.\n\nThe (ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study  shows that women comprise an estimated 24 percent of the cybersecurity workforce. While that’s far from an even (and ideal) 50-50 split, it’s certainly indicative of an upwards trend of more women joining the industry. For context, in 2017, women made up just 11 percent of the burgeoning cybersecurity sphere.\n\nIt’s worth noting that this study, while promising, has significantly changed the parameters of who is included in the sample by widening the professions eligible for inclusion.

If anything can be gleaned from this report, it’s that women have been doing infosec for a lot longer, and a lot more often, than has been previously recognized.\n\nWHAT IS AN INFOSEC WORKER?\nNot everyone in infosec is necessarily a penetration tester , and not everyone in infosec spends all their time sat dealing with security-related problems. It’s worth recognizing that this is a field that’s fundamentally multidisciplinary in nature, and people often wear multiple hats (all white, one hopes) while working in the same role.\n\nYou could be an instructor who trains office workers how to perform their jobs without exposing the business to any unnecessary security risks (like, for example, using random USB flash drives that you found on the street).

What’s a person to do when bombarded with confusing, contradictory information?</p><p>Try thinking like a scientist, says <a href="https://twitter.com/dremmafrans?lang=en">Emma Frans</a>, who’s an epidemiology and psychiatry researcher at Oxford University in the UK and Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.</p><p>“In present times, our risk of being fooled is especially high,” she says. There are two main factors at play: “Disinformation spreads like wildfire in social media,” she adds, “and when it comes to news reporting, sometimes it is more important for journalists to be fast than accurate.”</p><p>Which is why it’s useful to know how to evaluate news the way a scientist does. Scientists labor under a burden of proof. They must conduct experiments and collect data under controlled conditions to arrive at their conclusions — and be ready to defend their findings with facts, not emotions.</p><p>“We all have gut feelings and biases that sometimes cloud our judgment,” says Frans. But scientific thinking offers us tools for “evaluating information in a rational way.”</p><p>Try these 6 tips to read the news like a scientist:</p><h2><b>1. Cultivate your skepticism.</b></h2><p>Science moves forward by challenging accepted wisdom. You can do the same. When you learn a new piece of information through social media, think to yourself: “This may be true, but it also may be false,” Frans says. “This kind of healthy skepticism does not mean you’re dismissing everything as false — it simply means remembering the things you hear <i>could</i> be false, but they could also be true … or they could be something in between.”</p><h2><b>2. Find out who is making the claim.</b></h2><p>“In science, researchers have to declare potential conflicts of interest before publishing their findings,” says Frans. When you encounter a new claim, look for conflicts of interest. Ask: Do they stand to profit from what they say? Are they affiliated with an organization that could be swaying them? Two other questions to consider: What makes the writer or speaker qualified to comment on the topic? What statements have they made in the past?</p><h2><b>3. Watch out for the halo effect.</b></h2><p>The halo effect, says Frans, “is a cognitive bias that makes our feeling towards someone affect how we judge their claims. If we dislike someone, we are a lot more likely to disagree with them; if we like them, we are biased to agree.” It’s such a common human trait that the scientific community has devised a workaround: New scientific papers under review are read “blind,” with the authors’ names removed. That way, the experts who are deciding whether it’s worthy of publication don’t know which of their fellow scientists wrote it so they’ll be able to react free from pre-judgement or bias. You can try this with your own news feed, too. Maybe you’ve read about a jobs policy proposed by the candidate you favor, and you think it sounds good. Frans suggests, “Simply question how you would consider the claim if it came from someone else.”</p><h2><b>4. Look at the evidence.</b></h2><p>When evaluating a claim, Frans asks, “Can the sources be traced? Are they reliable? Is the conclusion based on a rational evaluation of the information?” And you should try to consider <i>all</i> of the research on a topic. She says, “For instance, if there is one study claiming that drinking wine is just as good for your health as going to the gym, this finding is not relevant if ninety-nine studies show the opposite.” Before you act on or share a particularly surprising or enraging story, do a quick Google search — you might learn something even more interesting.</p><h2><b>5. Beware of the tendency to cherry-pick information.</b></h2><p>Another human bias — confirmation bias — means we’re more likely to notice stories or facts that fit what we already believe (or want to believe). As Frans says, “When you search for information, you should not disregard the information that goes against whatever opinion you might have in advance.” Some scientists combat this by seeking out collaborators who, as management thinker <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/margaret_heffernan_dare_to_disagree/transcript?language=en">Margaret Heffernan</a> puts it, “aren’t echo chambers.” These are people who will actively try to prove you wrong and can help you check your ideas and assumptions. In your own life, look for friends and acquaintances on social media with alternative viewpoints. You don’t have to agree with them, or tolerate misinformation from them — but it’s healthy and balanced to have some variety in your information diet.</p><h2><b>6. Recognize the difference between correlation and causation.</b></h2><p>Frans researches ADHD and autism, and, she notes, in recent decades, “the number of individuals diagnosed with these disorders have increased rapidly.” Many possible causes have been raised, including vaccinations, video games and junk food. However, she says, “there is no evidence supporting these claims, and it’s important to remember that just because two things increase simultaneously, this does not mean that they are causally linked to each other. Correlation does not equal causality.” Keep this in mind when thinking about our world. For example, if there is a rise in violent crime in your area and it’s being blamed on gang activity, or if a politician is credited with creating a low unemployment rate, take a wider view and look into the other contributing factors. Frans says, “It’s important to remember that there might be alternative explanations to a phenomenon.”</p><p><i>Watch her <a href="https://tedxstockholm.com/">TEDxStockholm</a> talk here:</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/how-to-be-a-better-human/">how to be a better human</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/news-literacy/">news literacy</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/science-2/">science</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/scientists/">scientists</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/sweden/">sweden</a></li><li><a href="https://ideas.ted.com/tag/tedx/">TEDx</a></li></ul></div></div>',

      text: 'Jenice Kim\n\nOVERWHELMED BY YOUR NEWS FEED? USE TOOLS FROM SCIENCE TO EVALUATE WHAT’S TRUE AND WHAT’S FAKE, SUGGESTS RESEARCHER EMMA FRANS.\nThis post is part of TED’s “How to Be a Better Human” series, each of which contains a piece of helpful advice from someone in the TED community. To see all the posts, go here .\n\nIn our daily reading, we encounter all kinds of claims. Depending on the news story and the week, Chinese imports, coffee, large-cap stocks, snacking, and eggs should be embraced — or they should be avoided altogether. What’s a person to do when bombarded with confusing, contradictory information?\n\nTry thinking like a scientist, says Emma Frans , who’s an epidemiology and psychiatry researcher at Oxford University in the UK and Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.\n\n“In present times, our risk of being fooled is especially high,” she says. There are two main factors at play: “Disinformation spreads like wildfire in social media,” she adds, “and when it comes to news reporting, sometimes it is more important for journalists to be fast than accurate.”\n\nWhich is why it’s useful to know how to evaluate news the way a scientist does. Scientists labor under a burden of proof. They must conduct experiments and collect data under controlled conditions to arrive at their conclusions — and be ready to defend their findings with facts, not emotions.\n\n“We all have gut feelings and biases that sometimes cloud our judgment,” says Frans. But scientific thinking offers us tools for “evaluating information in a rational way.”\n\nTry these 6 tips to read the news like a scientist:\n\n1. CULTIVATE YOUR SKEPTICISM.\nScience moves forward by challenging accepted wisdom. You can do the same. When you learn a new piece of information through social media, think to yourself: “This may be true, but it also may be false,” Frans says. “This kind of healthy skepticism does not mean you’re dismissing everything as false — it simply means remembering the things you hear could be false, but they could also be true … or they could be something in between.”\n\n2. FIND OUT WHO IS MAKING THE CLAIM.\n“In science, researchers have to declare potential conflicts of interest before publishing their findings,” says Frans. When you encounter a new claim, look for conflicts of interest. Ask: Do they stand to profit from what they say? Are they affiliated with an organization that could be swaying them? Two other questions to consider: What makes the writer or speaker qualified to comment on the topic? What statements have they made in the past?\n\n3. WATCH OUT FOR THE HALO EFFECT.\nThe halo effect, says Frans, “is a cognitive bias that makes our feeling towards someone affect how we judge their claims. If we dislike someone, we are a lot more likely to disagree with them; if we like them, we are biased to agree.” It’s such a common human trait that the scientific community has devised a workaround: New scientific papers under review are read “blind,” with the authors’ names removed. That way, the experts who are deciding whether it’s worthy of publication don’t know which of their fellow scientists wrote it so they’ll be able to react free from pre-judgement or bias. You can try this with your own news feed, too. Maybe you’ve read about a jobs policy proposed by the candidate you favor, and you think it sounds good. Frans suggests, “Simply question how you would consider the claim if it came from someone else.”\n\n4. LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE.\nWhen evaluating a claim, Frans asks, “Can the sources be traced? Are they reliable? Is the conclusion based on a rational evaluation of the information?” And you should try to consider all of the research on a topic. She says, “For instance, if there is one study claiming that drinking wine is just as good for your health as going to the gym, this finding is not relevant if ninety-nine studies show the opposite.” Before you act on or share a particularly surprising or enraging story, do a quick Google search — you might learn something even more interesting.\n\n5. BEWARE OF THE TENDENCY TO CHERRY-PICK INFORMATION.\nAnother human bias — confirmation bias — means we’re more likely to notice stories or facts that fit what we already believe (or want to believe). As Frans says, “When you search for information, you should not disregard the information that goes against whatever opinion you might have in advance.” Some scientists combat this by seeking out collaborators who, as management thinker Margaret Heffernan  puts it, “aren’t echo chambers.” These are people who will actively try to prove you wrong and can help you check your ideas and assumptions. In your own life, look for friends and acquaintances on social media with alternative viewpoints. You don’t have to agree with them, or tolerate misinformation from them — but it’s healthy and balanced to have some variety in your information diet.\n\n6. RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CORRELATION AND CAUSATION.\nFrans researches ADHD and autism, and, she notes, in recent decades, “the number of individuals diagnosed with these disorders have increased rapidly.” Many possible causes have been raised, including vaccinations, video games and junk food. However, she says, “there is no evidence supporting these claims, and it’s important to remember that just because two things increase simultaneously, this does not mean that they are causally linked to each other. Correlation does not equal causality.” Keep this in mind when thinking about our world. For example, if there is a rise in violent crime in your area and it’s being blamed on gang activity, or if a politician is credited with creating a low unemployment rate, take a wider view and look into the other contributing factors. Frans says, “It’s important to remember that there might be alternative explanations to a phenomenon.”\n\nWatch her TEDxStockholm  talk here:\n\n-how to be a better human \n-news literacy \n-science \n-scientists \n-sweden \n-TEDx',

The aggregate global private investment in seven deep tech categories researched by BCG and Hello Tomorrow soared by more than 20% a year from 2015 through 2018 to reach almost $18 billion.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="9-216028-0"><div><div><p>Deep tech is no longer the primary purview of deep pockets—or of the scientific community. A number of trends have brought us to a point of major change in how deep tech research is pursued and how new technologies are brought to market. Innovation is a much more fragmented and diverse endeavor than ever before—geographically, functionally, and industrially. Some suggest that we are at the beginning of a new cycle that could carry R&amp;D for the next two to three generations or that we may be shifting from the end of one cycle, a “deployment” phase—which has been mostly about building applications that are based on existing information and communications technologies—to the beginning of an “installation” phase in which new technology infrastructures are constructed. Clearly, a new deep tech ecosystem is taking shape, with big ramifications for all players, most notably companies, investors, and startups.</p></div></div></div><div id="9-219032-1"><div><div><p>Two previous publications by BCG and Hello Tomorrow examined the business prospects for emerging technologies. (See “<a href="/publications/2017/technology-digital-joint-ventures-alliances-what-deep-tech-startups-corporate-partners.aspx">What Deep-Tech Startups Want from Corporate Partners</a>” and “<a href="/publications/2017/digital-joint-venture-alliances-framework-deep-tech-collaboration.aspx">A Framework for Deep-Tech Collaboration</a>,” articles by BCG and Hello Tomorrow, April 2017.) In the past year, BCG and Hello Tomorrow researched seven fields of deep tech endeavor and the roles of multiple types of deep tech ecosystem participants to gain a better understanding of how companies are conducting R&amp;D in emergent technologies today. The seven fields—advanced materials, artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, blockchain, drones and robotics, photonics and electronics, and quantum computing—constitute the most active and promising deep technologies and span the spectrum from very early research to market applications in full development. They therefore provide a representative picture of the deep tech landscape.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-2"><div><div><div><p>We relied on in-depth interviews, market research, examinations of funding, patent and publication data, and exclusive data from more than 2,000 deep tech startups. The resulting report, <a href="https://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-The-Dawn-of-the-Deep-Tech-Ecosystem-Mar-2019.pdf"><em>The Dawn of the Deep Tech Ecosystem</em></a>, tours the evolving ecosystem and offers observations on how the different types of participants can maximize the value of their engagement. It examines how corporations, investors, and startups active in deep tech need to think about their roles in the future. This article presents a summary of our findings and conclusions.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-3"><div><div><div><h2>Defining Deep Tech</h2><p>Three attributes in particular characterize deep tech in a business context. These technologies can have a big impact, take a long time to reach market-ready maturity, and require a significant amount of capital to develop and scale.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-4"><div><div><div><h3>Impact</h3><p>Innovations based on deep tech can generate enormous economic value, but their ultimate impact extends far beyond the financial realm to everyday life. Hello Tomorrow’s analysis of the 1,646 startups that qualified for its current annual Global Challenge, a startup competition that assesses deep tech startups on four criteria—technological innovation, business model, team skills, and expected impact—shows that these companies anticipate having an impact on a wide variety of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs). The goal receiving the most attention is good health and well-being (51% of startups), followed by those related to industry, innovation, and infrastructure (50%) and mitigating human impact on the environment (sustainable cities and communities—28%, responsible consumption and production—25%, climate action—22%, affordable and clean energy—18%, and clean water and sanitation—10%).</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-5"><div><div><div><h3>Time and Scale</h3><p>Deep tech takes time to move from basic science to a technology that can be applied to actual use cases. (Indeed, the incorporation of a startup is not the beginning of the story but a milestone in the development of a technology, when the science has been proven and the work starts to target a particular market.) The amount of time varies substantially by technology, though it is almost always longer than the time needed to develop an innovation based on a widely available technology (think of a new mobile application). Analysis of the startups in the Hello Tomorrow Challenge shows that it takes 4 years on average to develop a technology in biotech (1.8 years from incorporation to first prototype and another 2.2 years to reach the market), while the comparable figure is only 2.4 years for a startup in blockchain (1.4 years to first prototype and 1 year to market). The wild card is the technology itself, as each advance seems to speed the next.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-6"><div><div><div><h3>Investment</h3><p>The funding needs of deep tech companies vary significantly with the technology. For example, data from Hello Tomorrow’s Challenge participants shows that developing the first prototype in biotech costs an average of almost $1.3 million, but in blockchain, it costs only about $200,000. Several factors complicate tech investment. One is market risk. Many companies are seeking funding in the early research phase, long before they can put a product or even prototype in the hands of potential customers, meaning that investors have few if any KPIs with which they can evaluate traction and market potential. Another complicating factor is technology risk; many investors don’t have the specific expertise in-house that they need to accurately assess the potential of emerging technologies.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-7"><div><div><div><p>As a consequence, deep tech startups rarely follow the established funding progression of other types of young tech enterprises—seeking money from friends and family, then angel or seed investors, then successive rounds of venture capital investment at increasing valuations (which validate the decisions of previous investors), leading ultimately to a trade sale or an IPO. In deep tech, public funding plays an important role in the early phase, and friends-and-family money is rarely significant relative to the substantial capital requirements of early R&amp;D. Private-public financing schemes are becoming increasingly important to financing deep tech ventures along their entire life cycle, and corporate venture capital (CVC) funds, incubators, and accelerators also have become prevalent partners since they provide not only funding but other critical forms of support.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-8"><div><div><div><h2>What’s Driving Deep Tech?</h2><p>There have always been aggressive and visionary scientists and entrepreneurs. What’s changed is the ability of these individuals to access technological capabilities, financing, and other critical resources to bring their dreams into the real-life lab and perhaps to market. The growing deep tech ecosystem facilitates research into almost any kind of technology, from things we can’t see to concepts that relatively few can explain. This ecosystem is rooted in a handful of trends.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-9"><div><div><div><h3>The Rise of New Platform Technologies</h3><p>Innovation in the past few decades has been driven mainly by a few powerful platform technologies (silicon chips, desktop computers, the internet, and mobile technologies) that led to a wide variety of applications in many industries. Powerful new platform technologies are now emerging, paving the way for innovation in the next several decades. It’s happening simultaneously in software (machine learning), hardware (quantum computing), and biology (genetic sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9, which are reenergizing biotech). Their convergence multiplies their potential and creates the kind of momentum that drives new industrial revolutions.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-10"><div><div><div><h3>Falling Barriers</h3><p>As new platform technologies rise, barriers fall. Today’s innovators have a wealth of technological capability at their fingertips. PCs are inexpensive and powerful, and even more powerful computing hardware is on offer from cloud-based services. Easy access to hardware obviates big upfront capital expenditures for tech. Likewise, software is both open-source and widely available as a service. Computer-aided design and manufacturing and 3D printing have revolutionized prototyping. In biotechnology, sequencing and synthesizing DNA have become standard services.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-11"><div><div><div><h3>More Fragmentation and Diverse Approaches for Business</h3><p>Innovation today is a much more fragmented and varied endeavor than ever before. More young companies in more places are pursuing more new avenues of invention, and many of these involve advances in new technologies. Our research into seven deep technologies found an enormous breadth of activity. In AI, for example, we counted more than 1,300 companies in 48 countries and 401 cities. (See Exhibit 1.)</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-12"><div><div><div><div><p>At the same time, big corporations are diversifying their innovation programs, using CVC, incubators, and other venturing tools to gain access to new technologies. Research for this report shows that the number of private venture investments with CVC participation increased from 161 deals in 2015 to 203 in 2018, and the total value of private venture investments with CVC participation increased from approximately $3.2 billion in 2015 to $5.7 billion in 2018. In addition to their use of CVC, more and more large companies are deploying a variety of innovation investment and development vehicles, matching the tool to the circumstances (such as time to market) and their objectives (such as assessing new or disruptive technologies, improving existing technologies, or gaining control of a new technology).</p><p>One result of this fragmentation and diversity of effort is that knowledge, skills, and information, while much more accessible, are also harder to harness because they reside in more, and more disparate, places—geographically, industrially, and functionally. This disparity is driving the need for new models of collaboration in basic R&amp;D.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="section-13"><div><div><div><h3>Growth in Available Capital</h3><div><p>There has been no shortage of venture capital in recent years. According to Crunchbase, global venture deal value approached $100 billion in the third quarter of 2018, up more than 40% over 2017. Deal volume also rose 40% during this period, coming close to 10,000 rounds.</p><p>The capacity for startups to achieve new scientific and commercial levels of success has encouraged investors to infuse hundreds of billions of dollars into small companies. Our research shows plenty of funding activity for deep tech companies. (See Exhibit 2.) Both deep tech startups and more mature companies have attracted a greater amount of funding than other types of tech companies in the past five years. Deep tech companies have also completed more funding rounds.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="section-14"><div><div><div><p>Some of the ready availability of capital must be credited to the macroeconomic conditions, however—most significantly, the unprecedented period of low (or no) interest rates following the 2008 financial crisis, which appears to be coming to an end. In addition, many believe that the already high, and still rising, valuations of many tech unicorns cannot be sustained. Venture funding, like other types of capital, runs in cycles, and we should not be surprised to see a pullback in the coming years.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-15"><div><div><div><h3>A Shifting Role for Governments</h3><p>Governments around the world have undergone shifting roles in new technology R&amp;D support, with the two biggest players, the US and China, moving in opposite directions. In the US, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, federal spending on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP dropped from more than 1.2% in 1976 to about 0.7% in 2018. In contrast, China is on an R&amp;D tear. According to data compiled by the <em>Economist</em>, China’s spending on R&amp;D on a purchasing-power-parity basis has risen about 400% over the past two decades to exceed $400 billion a year and compete with that of Europe and the US. UNESCO data shows that total spending on R&amp;D in the US is equal to 2.7% of GDP, followed by China at 2.1% and the EU at 2.0%.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-16"><div><div><div><h3>Deep Problems Call for Deep Technologies</h3><p>The scientists and entrepreneurs working in deep tech are not put off by big problems—or the time and effort it takes to solve them. Indeed, for many, these problems are part of the attraction. Mitigating climate change, feeding 8 billion people, and keeping an aging population healthy are challenges that seem worth dedicating a career to—and also big markets that attract a lot of attention from startups, investors, and corporations alike.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-17"><div><div><div><h2>It Takes an Ecosystem</h2><div><p>From R&amp;D to industrialization and commercialization, deep tech today encompasses a broad ecosystem that includes multiple types of participants, each of which is active in one or more smaller ecosystems that is organized around a particular field of research, technology, industry, or mission. Business ecosystems are not new, of course, but deep tech ecosystems are nascent and operate in emerging—and therefore not yet stabilized—technologies and industries. As a consequence, they are a different breed and can be hard for traditional companies to navigate. Deep technologies also can affect entire value or supply chains and therefore require a more thorough analysis of the stakeholders’ interdependencies and value creation models in order to determine how to align goals, set strategies, and organize for interaction with others. Newcomers can find themselves in unfamiliar territory, and carving out a role can be complex, but they need to find their way.</p><p>Deep tech ecosystems have a set of characteristics that differentiate them from other business collaborations or partnerships. For one thing, they involve more types of players from more diverse sources in both the public and the private sectors, each of which has its own needs and priorities and makes its own contributions. (See Exhibit 3.)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="section-18"><div><div><div><p>In many ways, startups sit at the center of deep tech ecosystems because they play an important role in speeding the research, development, and commercialization of the new technology or product and sometimes leading radical innovation that is too risky for incumbents. They are assisted in their efforts by a variety of other actors, with some playing multiple roles. Investors, for example, provide funding but often also offer expertise in corporate development and go-to-market strategies as well as high-level contacts. Likewise, corporate partners provide funding and a host of other necessities, not least of which is access to markets and potential customers. Universities can be important research partners, and facilitators (such as accelerators) frequently play a key role in helping startups develop other necessary relationships.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="9-216029-19"><div><div><p>Deep tech ecosystems are highly dynamic—players come and go, and they create new kinds of relationships that are not always formal, defined by contracts, or well set. As the emerging technology or industry grows and matures, so do the relationships between the ecosystem’s stakeholders. Compared with early-stage startups, for example, mature startups in the commercialization phase need less technical, IP, and regulatory expertise and more visibility and access to the market. The attractiveness of various types of partners also shifts because startups turn to different stakeholders over time in order to gain access to needed resources. For example, the percentage of qualified startups in the 2018 Hello Tomorrow Challenge that are looking to corporate partners for help with product development drops from 38% to 24% between the experimental and the commercialization stages, while the percentage seeking assistance with product distribution rises from 24% to 47%.</p></div></div></div><div id="section-20"><div><div><div><div><p>In addition, deep tech collaborations rely less on a central orchestrator and more on multifaceted interactions among participants. Even when an ecosystem has a strong player at the center (generally the one that brought the other parties together), rarely is any entity in complete control. The orchestrator’s role is more that of magnet than managing partner. Each partner can influence the direction of the whole, and alliances among participants can also shift the balance of power over key strategic questions. Ecosystem management can be as much an exercise in diplomacy and negotiation as business strategy and direction.</p><p>And, while money is one important currency, it is far from the only means of exchange among participants. Knowledge, data, skills, expertise, contacts, and market access are also currencies that link ecosystem players. This means that traditional financial measures, such as revenues and profits, are not always the best means for assessing value realized. Deep tech ecosystems often involve relationships that are built around nontraditional, indirect, or nonfinancial linkages (involving data or services, for example) that push corporations, startups, investors, and others to develop new models for collaboration and remuneration. Ecosystem participants trade in a variety of currencies at the same time.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="section-21"><div><div><div><h2>The Rules of Win-Win in Deep Tech Ecosystems</h2><p>How each participant approaches the ecosystem affects its ability to achieve value as well as influence others and the whole. Companies, investors, startups, and others should be guided strategically by three questions about themselves and their goals.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-22"><div><div><div><h3>What Do We Bring to the Ecosystem?</h3><p>Since ecosystems operate on a win-win model, each participant needs to think about not only its own goals but the goals of the whole and how it can help the ecosystem advance a particular technology or market. The answer may be money, data, expertise, market access, or some other attribute. All participants need to contribute their currency, and make the ecosystem stronger, before they can realize their individual gains through commercial applications.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-23"><div><div><div><h3>What Do We Want from the Ecosystem?</h3><p>All participants should be clear on why they are engaging with the deep tech ecosystem and what they hope to achieve. One answer for many, of course, is ROI, but the goals—and their associated timeframes—should be detailed with as much specificity as possible. Participants need to assess the value realized from all dimensions, not only financial ones. Since the monetization of technology in its early stages can be difficult to predict, participants also need to build use cases and assess their potential long-term value before developing business models.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="section-24"><div><div><div><h3>How Do We Interact with Others to Achieve Our Goals?</h3><div><p>Two characteristics of ecosystems require a rethinking of textbook management techniques, especially for more traditional participants.</p><p>First, ecosystems are collaborative—they grow and strengthen through the continual interaction of all stakeholders toward a common end—and therefore the need for collaboration can trump more traditional competitive considerations. An automotive and an aerospace company might work with a startup on the development of next-generation batteries but so might two automakers, the startup, and a government agency because they all want the technology to come to market. Networks play an important role in collaboration because they foster the exchange of different ecosystem currencies.</p><p>Second, deep tech ecosystems’ endgame and path of progress are highly uncertain. Any given idea, startup—or emergent technology—may or may not succeed. Traditional top-down strategy and R&amp;D project management techniques need to be reinforced by methodologies designed to manage uncertainty. Different management approaches can provoke, foster, and increase the odds of the desired result, but they cannot engineer it. In such an environment, companies and investors should not think in terms of a single “bet” or “bets.” They need to engage with and nurture the entire ecosystem and look for the winning startups or technology to emerge from it.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="9-216037"><div><div><div><div><p>Finally, all participants can learn from failures.

      ssml: '<speak><p>The Dawn of the Deep Tech Ecosystem.</p><break time="500ms" /><p>Deep technologies—novel technologies that offer significant advances over those currently in use—are attracting an unprecedented amount of interest and activity. The aggregate global private investment in seven deep tech categories researched by BCG and Hello Tomorrow soared by more than 20% a year from 2015 through 2018 to reach almost $18 billion.</p><p>Deep tech is no longer the primary purview of deep pockets—or of the scientific community. A number of trends have brought us to a point of major change in how deep tech research is pursued and how new technologies are brought to market. Innovation is a much more fragmented and diverse endeavor than ever before—geographically, functionally, and industrially. Some suggest that we are at the beginning of a new cycle that could carry R&amp;D for the next two to three generations or that we may be shifting from the end of one cycle, a “deployment” phase—which has been mostly about building applications that are based on existing information and communications technologies—to the beginning of an “installation” phase in which new technology infrastructures are constructed. Clearly, a new deep tech ecosystem is taking shape, with big ramifications for all players, most notably companies, investors, and startups.</p><p>Two previous publications by BCG and Hello Tomorrow examined the business prospects for emerging technologies. (See “What Deep-Tech Startups Want from Corporate Partners” and “A Framework for Deep-Tech Collaboration,” articles by BCG and Hello Tomorrow, April 2017.) In the past year, BCG and Hello Tomorrow researched seven fields of deep tech endeavor and the roles of multiple types of deep tech ecosystem participants to gain a better understanding of how companies are conducting R&amp;D in emergent technologies today. The seven fields—advanced materials, artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, blockchain, drones and robotics, photonics and electronics, and quantum computing—constitute the most active and promising deep technologies and span the spectrum from very early research to market applications in full development. They therefore provide a representative picture of the deep tech landscape.</p><p>We relied on in-depth interviews, market research, examinations of funding, patent and publication data, and exclusive data from more than 2,000 deep tech startups. The resulting report, The Dawn of the Deep Tech Ecosystem, tours the evolving ecosystem and offers observations on how the different types of participants can maximize the value of their engagement. It examines how corporations, investors, and startups active in deep tech need to think about their roles in the future. This article presents a summary of our findings and conclusions.</p><p>Defining Deep Tech<break time="1s" />.</p><p>Three attributes in particular characterize deep tech in a business context. These technologies can have a big impact, take a long time to reach market-ready maturity, and require a significant amount of capital to develop and scale.</p><p>Impact<break time="1s" />.</p><p>Innovations based on deep tech can generate enormous economic value, but their ultimate impact extends far beyond the financial realm to everyday life. Hello Tomorrow’s analysis of the 1,646 startups that qualified for its current annual Global Challenge, a startup competition that assesses deep tech startups on four criteria—technological innovation, business model, team skills, and expected impact—shows that these companies anticipate having an impact on a wide variety of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs). The goal receiving the most attention is good health and well-being (51% of startups), followed by those related to industry, innovation, and infrastructure (50%) and mitigating human impact on the environment (sustainable cities and communities—28%, responsible consumption and production—25%, climate action—22%, affordable and clean energy—18%, and clean water and sanitation—10%).</p><p>Time and Scale<break time="1s" />.</p><p>Deep tech takes time to move from basic science to a technology that can be applied to actual use cases. (Indeed, the incorporation of a startup is not the beginning of the story but a milestone in the development of a technology, when the science has been proven and the work starts to target a particular market.) The amount of time varies substantially by technology, though it is almost always longer than the time needed to develop an innovation based on a widely available technology (think of a new mobile application). Analysis of the startups in the Hello Tomorrow Challenge shows that it takes 4 years on average to develop a technology in biotech (1.8 years from incorporation to first prototype and another 2.2 years to reach the market), while the comparable figure is only 2.4 years for a startup in blockchain (1.4 years to first prototype and 1 year to market). The wild card is the technology itself, as each advance seems to speed the next.</p><p>Investment<break time="1s" />.</p><p>The funding needs of deep tech companies vary significantly with the technology. For example, data from Hello Tomorrow’s Challenge participants shows that developing the first prototype in biotech costs an average of almost $1.3 million, but in blockchain, it costs only about $200,000. Several factors complicate tech investment. One is market risk. Many companies are seeking funding in the early research phase, long before they can put a product or even prototype in the hands of potential customers, meaning that investors have few if any KPIs with which they can evaluate traction and market potential. Another complicating factor is technology risk; many investors don’t have the specific expertise in-house that they need to accurately assess the potential of emerging technologies.</p><p>As a consequence, deep tech startups rarely follow the established funding progression of other types of young tech enterprises—seeking money from friends and family, then angel or seed investors, then successive rounds of venture capital investment at increasing valuations (which validate the decisions of previous investors), leading ultimately to a trade sale or an IPO. In deep tech, public funding plays an important role in the early phase, and friends-and-family money is rarely significant relative to the substantial capital requirements of early R&amp;D. Private-public financing schemes are becoming increasingly important to financing deep tech ventures along their entire life cycle, and corporate venture capital (CVC) funds, incubators, and accelerators also have become prevalent partners since they provide not only funding but other critical forms of support.</p><p>What’s Driving Deep Tech?<break time="1s" />.</p><p>There have always been aggressive and visionary scientists and entrepreneurs. What’s changed is the ability of these individuals to access technological capabilities, financing, and other critical resources to bring their dreams into the real-life lab and perhaps to market. The growing deep tech ecosystem facilitates research into almost any kind of technology, from things we can’t see to concepts that relatively few can explain. This ecosystem is rooted in a handful of trends.</p><p>The Rise of New Platform Technologies<break time="1s" />.</p><p>Innovation in the past few decades has been driven mainly by a few powerful platform technologies (silicon chips, desktop computers, the internet, and mobile technologies) that led to a wide variety of applications in many industries. Powerful new platform technologies are now emerging, paving the way for innovation in the next several decades. It’s happening simultaneously in software (machine learning), hardware (quantum computing), and biology (genetic sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9, which are reenergizing biotech). Their convergence multiplies their potential and creates the kind of momentum that drives new industrial revolutions.</p><p>Falling Barriers<break time="1s" />.</p><p>As new platform technologies rise, barriers fall. Today’s innovators have a wealth of technological capability at their fingertips. PCs are inexpensive and powerful, and even more powerful computing hardware is on offer from cloud-based services. Easy access to hardware obviates big upfront capital expenditures for tech. Likewise, software is both open-source and widely available as a service. Computer-aided design and manufacturing and 3D printing have revolutionized prototyping. In biotechnology, sequencing and synthesizing DNA have become standard services.</p><p>More Fragmentation and Diverse Approaches for Business<break time="1s" />.</p><p>Innovation today is a much more fragmented and varied endeavor than ever before. More young companies in more places are pursuing more new avenues of invention, and many of these involve advances in new technologies. Our research into seven deep technologies found an enormous breadth of activity. In AI, for example, we counted more than 1,300 companies in 48 countries and 401 cities. (See Exhibit 1.)</p><p>At the same time, big corporations are diversifying their innovation programs, using CVC, incubators, and other venturing tools to gain access to new technologies. Research for this report shows that the number of private venture investments with CVC participation increased from 161 deals in 2015 to 203 in 2018, and the total value of private venture investments with CVC participation increased from approximately $3.2 billion in 2015 to $5.7 billion in 2018. In addition to their use of CVC, more and more large companies are deploying a variety of innovation investment and development vehicles, matching the tool to the circumstances (such as time to market) and their objectives (such as assessing new or disruptive technologies, improving existing technologies, or gaining control of a new technology).</p><p>One result of this fragmentation and diversity of effort is that knowledge, skills, and information, while much more accessible, are also harder to harness because they reside in more, and more disparate, places—geographically, industrially, and functionally. This disparity is driving the need for new models of collaboration in basic R&amp;D.</p><p>Growth in Available Capital<break time="1s" />.</p><p>There has been no shortage of venture capital in recent years. According to Crunchbase, global venture deal value approached $100 billion in the third quarter of 2018, up more than 40% over 2017. Deal volume also rose 40% during this period, coming close to 10,000 rounds.</p><p>The capacity for startups to achieve new scientific and commercial levels of success has encouraged investors to infuse hundreds of billions of dollars into small companies. Our research shows plenty of funding activity for deep tech companies. (See Exhibit 2.) Both deep tech startups and more mature companies have attracted a greater amount of funding than other types of tech companies in the past five years. Deep tech companies have also completed more funding rounds.</p><p>Some of the ready availability of capital must be credited to the macroeconomic conditions, however—most significantly, the unprecedented period of low (or no) interest rates following the 2008 financial crisis, which appears to be coming to an end. In addition, many believe that the already high, and still rising, valuations of many tech unicorns cannot be sustained. Venture funding, like other types of capital, runs in cycles, and we should not be surprised to see a pullback in the coming years.</p><p>A Shifting Role for Governments<break time="1s" />.</p><p>Governments around the world have undergone shifting roles in new technology R&amp;D support, with the two biggest players, the US and China, moving in opposite directions. In the US, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, federal spending on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP dropped from more than 1.2% in 1976 to about 0.7% in 2018. In contrast, China is on an R&amp;D tear. According to data compiled by the Economist, China’s spending on R&amp;D on a purchasing-power-parity basis has risen about 400% over the past two decades to exceed $400 billion a year and compete with that of Europe and the US. UNESCO data shows that total spending on R&amp;D in the US is equal to 2.7% of GDP, followed by China at 2.1% and the EU at 2.0%.</p><p>Deep Problems Call for Deep Technologies<break time="1s" />.</p><p>The scientists and entrepreneurs working in deep tech are not put off by big problems—or the time and effort it takes to solve them. Indeed, for many, these problems are part of the attraction. Mitigating climate change, feeding 8 billion people, and keeping an aging population healthy are challenges that seem worth dedicating a career to—and also big markets that attract a lot of attention from startups, investors, and corporations alike.</p><p>It Takes an Ecosystem<break time="1s" />.</p><p>From R&amp;D to industrialization and commercialization, deep tech today encompasses a broad ecosystem that includes multiple types of participants, each of which is active in one or more smaller ecosystems that is organized around a particular field of research, technology, industry, or mission. Business ecosystems are not new, of course, but deep tech ecosystems are nascent and operate in emerging—and therefore not yet stabilized—technologies and industries. As a consequence, they are a different breed and can be hard for traditional companies to navigate. Deep technologies also can affect entire value or supply chains and therefore require a more thorough analysis of the stakeholders’ interdependencies and value creation models in order to determine how to align goals, set strategies, and organize for interaction with others. Newcomers can find themselves in unfamiliar territory, and carving out a role can be complex, but they need to find their way.</p><p>Deep tech ecosystems have a set of characteristics that differentiate them from other business collaborations or partnerships. For one thing, they involve more types of players from more diverse sources in both the public and the private sectors, each of which has its own needs and priorities and makes its own contributions. (See Exhibit 3.)</p><p>In many ways, startups sit at the center of deep tech ecosystems because they play an important role in speeding the research, development, and commercialization of the new technology or product and sometimes leading radical innovation that is too risky for incumbents. They are assisted in their efforts by a variety of other actors, with some playing multiple roles. Investors, for example, provide funding but often also offer expertise in corporate development and go-to-market strategies as well as high-level contacts. Likewise, corporate partners provide funding and a host of other necessities, not least of which is access to markets and potential customers. Universities can be important research partners, and facilitators (such as accelerators) frequently play a key role in helping startups develop other necessary relationships.</p><p>Deep tech ecosystems are highly dynamic—players come and go, and they create new kinds of relationships that are not always formal, defined by contracts, or well set. As the emerging technology or industry grows and matures, so do the relationships between the ecosystem’s stakeholders. Compared with early-stage startups, for example, mature startups in the commercialization phase need less technical, IP, and regulatory expertise and more visibility and access to the market. The attractiveness of various types of partners also shifts because startups turn to different stakeholders over time in order to gain access to needed resources. For example, the percentage of qualified startups in the 2018 Hello Tomorrow Challenge that are looking to corporate partners for help with product development drops from 38% to 24% between the experimental and the commercialization stages, while the percentage seeking assistance with product distribution rises from 24% to 47%.</p><p>In addition, deep tech collaborations rely less on a central orchestrator and more on multifaceted interactions among participants. Even when an ecosystem has a strong player at the center (generally the one that brought the other parties together), rarely is any entity in complete control. The orchestrator’s role is more that of magnet than managing partner. Each partner can influence the direction of the whole, and alliances among participants can also shift the balance of power over key strategic questions. Ecosystem management can be as much an exercise in diplomacy and negotiation as business strategy and direction.</p><p>And, while money is one important currency, it is far from the only means of exchange among participants. Knowledge, data, skills, expertise, contacts, and market access are also currencies that link ecosystem players. This means that traditional financial measures, such as revenues and profits, are not always the best means for assessing value realized. Deep tech ecosystems often involve relationships that are built around nontraditional, indirect, or nonfinancial linkages (involving data or services, for example) that push corporations, startups, investors, and others to develop new models for collaboration and remuneration. Ecosystem participants trade in a variety of currencies at the same time.</p><p>The Rules of Win-Win in Deep Tech Ecosystems<break time="1s" />.</p><p>How each participant approaches the ecosystem affects its ability to achieve value as well as influence others and the whole. Companies, investors, startups, and others should be guided strategically by three questions about themselves and their goals.</p><p>What Do We Bring to the Ecosystem?<break time="1s" />.</p><p>Since ecosystems operate on a win-win model, each participant needs to think about not only its own goals but the goals of the whole and how it can help the ecosystem advance a particular technology or market. The answer may be money, data, expertise, market access, or some other attribute. All participants need to contribute their currency, and make the ecosystem stronger, before they can realize their individual gains through commercial applications.</p><p>What Do We Want from the Ecosystem?<break time="1s" />.</p><p>All participants should be clear on why they are engaging with the deep tech ecosystem and what they hope to achieve.

The growing deep tech ecosystem facilitates research into almost any kind of technology, from things we can’t see to concepts that relatively few can explain.

Powerful new platform technologies are now emerging, paving the way for innovation in the next several decades.

According to Crunchbase, global venture deal value approached $100 billion in the third quarter of 2018, up more than 40% over 2017.

Newcomers can find themselves in unfamiliar territory, and carving out a role can be complex, but they need to find their way.\n\nDeep tech ecosystems have a set of characteristics that differentiate them from other business collaborations or partnerships. For one thing, they involve more types of players from more diverse sources in both the public and the private sectors, each of which has its own needs and priorities and makes its own contributions. (See Exhibit 3.)\n\nIn many ways, startups sit at the center of deep tech ecosystems because they play an important role in speeding the research, development, and commercialization of the new technology or product and sometimes leading radical innovation that is too risky for incumbents. They are assisted in their efforts by a variety of other actors, with some playing multiple roles. Investors, for example, provide funding but often also offer expertise in corporate development and go-to-market strategies as well as high-level contacts. Likewise, corporate partners provide funding and a host of other necessities, not least of which is access to markets and potential customers. Universities can be important research partners, and facilitators (such as accelerators) frequently play a key role in helping startups develop other necessary relationships.\n\nDeep tech ecosystems are highly dynamic—players come and go, and they create new kinds of relationships that are not always formal, defined by contracts, or well set. As the emerging technology or industry grows and matures, so do the relationships between the ecosystem’s stakeholders. Compared with early-stage startups, for example, mature startups in the commercialization phase need less technical, IP, and regulatory expertise and more visibility and access to the market. The attractiveness of various types of partners also shifts because startups turn to different stakeholders over time in order to gain access to needed resources. For example, the percentage of qualified startups in the 2018 Hello Tomorrow Challenge that are looking to corporate partners for help with product development drops from 38% to 24% between the experimental and the commercialization stages, while the percentage seeking assistance with product distribution rises from 24% to 47%.\n\nIn addition, deep tech collaborations rely less on a central orchestrator and more on multifaceted interactions among participants. Even when an ecosystem has a strong player at the center (generally the one that brought the other parties together), rarely is any entity in complete control. The orchestrator’s role is more that of magnet than managing partner. Each partner can influence the direction of the whole, and alliances among participants can also shift the balance of power over key strategic questions. Ecosystem management can be as much an exercise in diplomacy and negotiation as business strategy and direction.\n\nAnd, while money is one important currency, it is far from the only means of exchange among participants. Knowledge, data, skills, expertise, contacts, and market access are also currencies that link ecosystem players. This means that traditional financial measures, such as revenues and profits, are not always the best means for assessing value realized. Deep tech ecosystems often involve relationships that are built around nontraditional, indirect, or nonfinancial linkages (involving data or services, for example) that push corporations, startups, investors, and others to develop new models for collaboration and remuneration. Ecosystem participants trade in a variety of currencies at the same time.\n\nTHE RULES OF WIN-WIN IN DEEP TECH ECOSYSTEMS\nHow each participant approaches the ecosystem affects its ability to achieve value as well as influence others and the whole. Companies, investors, startups, and others should be guided strategically by three questions about themselves and their goals.\n\nWHAT DO WE BRING TO THE ECOSYSTEM?\nSince ecosystems operate on a win-win model, each participant needs to think about not only its own goals but the goals of the whole and how it can help the ecosystem advance a particular technology or market. The answer may be money, data, expertise, market access, or some other attribute. All participants need to contribute their currency, and make the ecosystem stronger, before they can realize their individual gains through commercial applications.\n\nWHAT DO WE WANT FROM THE ECOSYSTEM?\nAll participants should be clear on why they are engaging with the deep tech ecosystem and what they hope to achieve. One answer for many, of course, is ROI, but the goals—and their associated timeframes—should be detailed with as much specificity as possible. Participants need to assess the value realized from all dimensions, not only financial ones. Since the monetization of technology in its early stages can be difficult to predict, participants also need to build use cases and assess their potential long-term value before developing business models.\n\nHOW DO WE INTERACT WITH OTHERS TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS?\nTwo characteristics of ecosystems require a rethinking of textbook management techniques, especially for more traditional participants.\n\nFirst, ecosystems are collaborative—they grow and strengthen through the continual interaction of all stakeholders toward a common end—and therefore the need for collaboration can trump more traditional competitive considerations. An automotive and an aerospace company might work with a startup on the development of next-generation batteries but so might two automakers, the startup, and a government agency because they all want the technology to come to market. Networks play an important role in collaboration because they foster the exchange of different ecosystem currencies.\n\nSecond, deep tech ecosystems’ endgame and path of progress are highly uncertain. Any given idea, startup—or emergent technology—may or may not succeed. Traditional top-down strategy and R&D project management techniques need to be reinforced by methodologies designed to manage uncertainty. Different management approaches can provoke, foster, and increase the odds of the desired result, but they cannot engineer it. In such an environment, companies and investors should not think in terms of a single “bet” or “bets.” They need to engage with and nurture the entire ecosystem and look for the winning startups or technology to emerge from it.\n\nFinally, all participants can learn from failures. It is in the very nature of deep tech that many ventures will not succeed. But they will almost always impart lessons that can inform the next initiative or collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are in the early days of the new deep tech ecosystem paradigm. Players, roles, and rules will all evolve as new discoveries are made and technologies demonstrate their potential. Perhaps the first rule for all would-be stakeholders is to set their goals and get into the game. Only then can they really learn—including from failures—and tap into the power and potential of the win-win ecosystem.\n\nDownload the full report \n\nArnaud de la Tour\n\nCofounder & CEO, Hello Tomorrow\n\nParis',

When YouTube celebrity Casey Neistat asked his followers if he had anything to worry about from too much seltzer water consumption, Leo, a user who requested anonymity for this piece, <a href="https://twitter.com/krispuckett/status/962560814174490624">recommended NovaMin</a>. Leo told <em>Elemental </em>he keeps a cache of the product on hand.</p><p>“Usually when my wife or myself travel, we’ll pick up a few tubes.” he said. Leo says his dentist says his teeth look fantastic.</p><p>But for consumers in the United States, the hyped product is often accompanied by a crucial caveat: Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin is not available for sale there, meaning that customers have to pay as much as $10 for a 75ml tube to be shipped from overseas.</p><p>So is Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin as radically good as its fans think it is? And if so, why isn’t it being sold in the U.S.?</p><p>To understand what Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin does, you first have to understand teeth. The outer layer of our teeth contain dentinal tubules, or tiny canals — up to 50,000 per square millimeter. These canals travel from the outside of the tooth to the inner “pulp,” where the nerves are located. When dentinal fluid is pushed through these canals by pressure, hot and cold liquids, or food, it can trigger the nerves and cause pain, according to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927677/">hydrodynamic theory</a> on dentinal hypersensitivity.</p><p>That’s where a material called bioactive glass — the supposedly revolutionary material underlying NovaMin — comes in. Bioactive glass, or bioglass, was developed by the late Larry Hench, a Department of Defense contractor. According to his 2006 article, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10856-006-0432-z">The Story of Bioglass</a>” in the <em>Journal of Materials Science, </em>Hench was attempting “something new, to discover a material that would not form an interfacial layer of scar tissue but instead would form a living bond with the host tissues.” Hench turned to vanadium phosphate glasses, a material used in semiconductors.</p><p><a href="http://profiles.ucsf.edu/grayson.marshall">Dr. Grayson Marshall</a>, a dentist in the Division of Biomaterials and Bioengineering in the Department of Preventative and Restorative Dental Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, says that initially, bioglass was thought to be “bioconductive,” and simply provided the necessary components for tooth tissue to form. However, says Marshall, it was later found to be “bioinductive,” in that it actually “alters gene expression” and makes the tooth more effective in repairing itself. This means bioglass can serve as a building block to cover dentinal tubules, decreasing tooth sensitivity in the process.</p><p>In the mid-1990s, two University of Maryland dentists put bioglass into toothpaste, in the form of calcium sodium phosphosilicate, and saw dramatic results for treating tooth sensitivity. By 2007, the two had developed a marketable toothpaste, which the <em>Washington Examiner</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/additive-helps-teeth-rebuild-enamel">covered</a> in a story titled “Additive helps teeth rebuild enamel.” The product and company was called NovaMin, which sat under a larger company called US Biomaterials. In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/glaxosmithkline-acquires-novamin-technology-inc--86ef8ed5#section-overview">bought NovaMin for $135 million</a>. In 2011, the toothpaste was introduced across Europe.</p><p>“To know that our invention will now have a positive impact globally on dental pain and help those individuals suffering from sensitive teeth is very rewarding,” said Gary Hack, DDS, the co-inventor of NovaMin, in a 2011 announcement.</p><p>But eight years later, Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin is still not available in the U.S. Asked if and when GlaxoSmithKline applied for FDA approval for NovaMin, a spokesperson for the company said, “GSK Consumer Healthcare is unable to answer this question due to scientific research and commercial strategy confidentiality.” The spokesperson also added that “toothpaste with NovaMin and without fluoride has been cleared by FDA as a medical device for in-office use.”</p><p>An FDA spokesperson also weighed in, saying, “We cannot comment on why a product is not approved in the U.S. The company would need to discuss their marketing.”</p><p>There are a number of reasons — economic, social, technological, ecological, and legal — why a company might introduce a product in one market, but not another. But the company’s tight-lipped explanation has fueled speculation, and conspiracy theories, around the absence of Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin from the U.S. shelves.</p><p>One <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13365369">theory</a> claims GSK is in the pocket of “Big Dental.” In turn, the company is withholding NovaMin so that consumers have to pay for more expensive in-office procedures. <a href="https://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/gsk-drops-ball-with-puzzling-us-release-of-sensodyne-repair-protect-sans-45s5-glass">Another</a> theory argues that the FDA approved NovaMin for use in over the counter toothpaste, but had qualms with the term “Repair” in the name of the product.</p><p>“GSK couldn’t market the ‘Repair’ part because bioglass isn’t really repairing the enamel, just protecting it beyond fluoride,” says Leo. In a December 2016 post on Reddit’s Q&amp;A section r/IamA, a technician <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5iebf6/iama_technician_at_a_toothpaste_factory_ama/">claiming to work</a> in a toothpaste factory repeated the theory.</p><p>“NovaMin didn’t make it into U.S. markets due to regulatory obstacles, though my guess is Sensodyne/GSK is working on that. Making the label claim that the toothpaste restores enamel will really challenge the way toothpaste is currently registered/regulated by the FDA whereas the MHRA in the EU is very relaxed on toothpaste,” said user PasteGuy. (PasteGuy’s identity was not verified.)</p><p>Leo notes that at different times, Burt’s Bees and Dr. Collins both sold toothpaste products that contained the NovaMin compound under it’s nonbranded name, calcium sodium phosphosilicate. A<a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/burts_bees/natural_toothpastes/prweb3698464.htm"> 2010 press release</a> from Burt’s Bees confirms the existence of the product, and a 2014 <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/made-in-america-burts-bee_b_5178196">blog</a> from HuffPo lamented that it had been taken off the market. Today, a discontinued four pack of 4-ounce tubes of the stuff <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Natural-Toothpaste-Multicare/dp/B00394DVI2">sells for $49.99</a> on Amazon.</p><p>Terry* has been using toothpaste with NovaMin since 2015 and is a convert. “I have had no new cavities or needed any major dental work in that time. I had a few cavities filled prior to that, but I can’t recall right now how many filings I actually have,” she said over direct message on Reddit. Terry is based in the U.S., and buys her Sensodyne with Novamin from Amazon or Ebay.</p><p>Terry doesn’t know why the toothpaste isn’t sold in the U.S., but says, “I’m sure money is involved somehow. Possibly more money to be made through ‘remineralizing’ treatments in dental offices versus an at-home solution?”</p><p>For Terry, the absence of Sensodyne from drugstore shelves is a question of justice. “I’m not passionate about toothpaste but I get heated about pharmaceutical companies and using restrictive patents/copyrights to jack up prices for medications/products which could improve people’s health and lives.”</p><p>Conspiracy theories in dental care are not uncommon. A recent <em>Atlantic </em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/the-trouble-with-dentistry/586039/">feature</a> detailed how one dentist bilked customers for tens of thousands of dollars with superfluous treatments, as well as procedures charged for but never actually performed. Patients that have been taken advantage of are more likely to turn to conspiracy theories and self-guided research. For instance, a small but vocal community has long believed that water supplies around the country are fluoridated in order <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-great-public-health-conspiracy-73f7ac6fb4e0">to control the public’s behavior — a completely unfounded accusation.</a></p><p>Though none of the dental professionals I spoke with knew why Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect with NovaMin was not being sold in the United States, they suspected more benign reasons.</p><p>“I can’t imagine they’re making much money off of it keeping it so exclusive,” says Daniel Jeremy Lopez, a registered dental hygienist in New York, and a moderator of a dentistry and dental hygiene subreddit. But, he adds, “I don’t understand big pharmaceutical company motives.”</p><p>In an interview with<em> Elemental</em>, Hack likened the product to a cure-all that could undermine a billion dollar dental industry. But when pressed, he says, “I believe that it is possibly a business decision on the part of the manufacturer.”</p><p>Dr. Matthias Zehnder, head of the Division of Endodontology at University of Zürich, is puzzled by the obsession with the toothpaste, and, in an email correspondence, called the topic “somewhat enigmatic.” He referred to <a href="http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/gsk-drops-ball-with-puzzling-us-release-of-sensodyne-repair-protect-sans-45s5-glass">two</a> <a href="http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/biomaterials/biomin-bioglass-toothpaste-may-better-protect-sensitive-teeth-and-find-its-way-into-us-market">articles</a> from Ceramics.org that theorized why the product was not on U.S. shelves, and added his own take.</p><p>“It may be speculated that, because this Sensodyne toothpaste contains fluoride and bioglass 45S5 (NovaMin), it is considered to be a medication in the U.S. and thus the manufacturer refrained from keeping it on the market as such.”</p><p>“The toothpaste industry is a strange club,” he added. “They put all kinds of stuff in toothpaste and hope it helps. :-)”</p><p>Other medical professionals I spoke with questioned the supposed miracle powers of NovaMin. Dr. William Landis, PhD, a professor and Interim Division Chair in Department of Preventative and Restorative Dental Sciences in the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry, says, “Whether bioglass is as effective in its applications with teeth as it is with bone is conjectural… There are literature reports that bioglass is efficacious in some applications with teeth, but others that it is no more efficacious than products containing fluoride alone.”</p><p>Asked if he’d recommend NovaMin to his patients, Dr. Landis says “My outside perspective is that I am not aware of a risk, but I would also not recommend the product for remineralization compared to other products already on the U.S. market that contain fluoride. I believe the latter do a very good job in their own right without the need for an additional additive such as NovaMin.” In other words, he’s just as likely to recommend a NovaMin toothpaste as a standard tube of Colgate.</p><p>And though the internet is glowing with positive reviews for the stuff, not all NovaMin users will find relief.</p><p>Lopez first heard of NovaMin in dental school in 2012 and has followed the hype since. He says he would only recommend using the product “in extreme cases where other options have proved ineffective.” He is not an evangelist for Sensodyne with NovaMin.</p><p>“Novamin can only block up dentinal tubules, which means it really only works for inhibiting cold/fluid sensitivity. It does nothing to actually address irritable pulp/nerves. Only potassium nitrate can do that,” he says.</p><p>Lopez also points out that different treatments have different effects on different people. “There isn’t one magic compound that solves everyone’s problem,” Lopez said. He knows from personal experience. Lopez says he has tooth sensitivity, which he attributes to sensitive pulp. He has used NovaMin products for “a few months at a time.” He never felt relief.</p></div></div>',

      text: 'AMERICAN CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING BIG BUCKS TO IMPORT TINY TUBES OF TOOTHPASTE\n \n\nOn the r/LegalAdvice subreddit, readers can “ask simple legal questions” like how to handle a $60,000 inheritance, or what to do when your car is repossessed, or whether an individual has legal recourse if an ex deletes a college thesis. On January 7, 2016, a poster sought advice on the shipment of unsanctioned contraband. “…the company refuses to sell it here,” wrote Reddit user orochiman. “Just wondering if the feds will come shoot my dog if I order it from Europe.” The substance in question? Toothpaste.\n\nSensodyne Repair & Protect with NovaMin has established a cult following among those seeking to treat tooth sensitivity. Alex*, a 45-year-old who works in IT in France, says he discovered the toothpaste in 2012 while living in Romania. (*Alex requested anonymity for this article, as did several other Reddit users contacted for this story.)\n\n“I was having a lot of trouble with cracks and holes in my tooth enamel and the dentists were saying the only solution is crowning a lot of my teeth,” Alex said over Reddit direct message. After using this toothpaste, he said, “I was a new man. Not only did my teeth stop hurting but the enamel damage seemed to be repaired. The NovaMin was filling in the cracks.” Alex said he’s “basically addicted” to the toothpaste, as the cracks return after a week without the product.\n\nIn a NovaMin-inspired Twitter thread, PC Magazine senior features writer Chandra Steele praised the toothpaste, saying that the product was “endorsed by my teeth after having used it for a month. (They look fabulous.)” Glowing reviews pop-up across the internet: from subreddits r/Dentistry and /r/LifeProTips, to mentions on Quora , Y Combinator’s Hacker News , Twitter , and specialized sites like dentalhypotheses.com  and Ceramics.org . On Amazon, a reviewer  called it the “best toothpaste ever” and the few negative reviews tend to focus on the size of the packaging — there’s not enough of the stuff! — or complaints about counterfeits. When YouTube celebrity Casey Neistat asked his followers if he had anything to worry about from too much seltzer water consumption, Leo, a user who requested anonymity for this piece, recommended NovaMin . Leo told Elemental he keeps a cache of the product on hand.\n\n“Usually when my wife or myself travel, we’ll pick up a few tubes.” he said. Leo says his dentist says his teeth look fantastic.\n\nBut for consumers in the United States, the hyped product is often accompanied by a crucial caveat: Sensodyne Repair & Protect with NovaMin is not available for sale there, meaning that customers have to pay as much as $10 for a 75ml tube to be shipped from overseas.\n\nSo is Sensodyne Repair & Protect with NovaMin as radically good as its fans think it is? And if so, why isn’t it being sold in the U.S.?\n\nTo understand what Sensodyne Repair & Protect with NovaMin does, you first have to understand teeth. The outer layer of our teeth contain dentinal tubules, or tiny canals — up to 50,000 per square millimeter. These canals travel from the outside of the tooth to the inner “pulp,” where the nerves are located. When dentinal fluid is pushed through these canals by pressure, hot and cold liquids, or food, it can trigger the nerves and cause pain, according to the hydrodynamic theory  on dentinal hypersensitivity.\n\nThat’s where a material called bioactive glass — the supposedly revolutionary material underlying NovaMin — comes in. Bioactive glass, or bioglass, was developed by the late Larry Hench, a Department of Defense contractor. According to his 2006 article, “The Story of Bioglass ” in the Journal of Materials Science, Hench was attempting “something new, to discover a material that would not form an interfacial layer of scar tissue but instead would form a living bond with the host tissues.” Hench turned to vanadium phosphate glasses, a material used in semiconductors.\n\nDr. Grayson Marshall , a dentist in the Division of Biomaterials and Bioengineering in the Department of Preventative and Restorative Dental Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, says that initially, bioglass was thought to be “bioconductive,” and simply provided the necessary components for tooth tissue to form. However, says Marshall, it was later found to be “bioinductive,” in that it actually “alters gene expression” and makes the tooth more effective in repairing itself. This means bioglass can serve as a building block to cover dentinal tubules, decreasing tooth sensitivity in the process.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, two University of Maryland dentists put bioglass into toothpaste, in the form of calcium sodium phosphosilicate, and saw dramatic results for treating tooth sensitivity. By 2007, the two had developed a marketable toothpaste, which the Washington Examiner covered  in a story titled “Additive helps teeth rebuild enamel.” The product and company was called NovaMin, which sat under a larger company called US Biomaterials. In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) bought NovaMin for $135 million . In 2011, the toothpaste was introduced across Europe.\n\n“To know that our invention will now have a positive impact globally on dental pain and help those individuals suffering from sensitive teeth is very rewarding,” said Gary Hack, DDS, the co-inventor of NovaMin, in a 2011 announcement.\n\nBut eight years later, Sensodyne Repair & Protect with NovaMin is still not available in the U.S. Asked if and when GlaxoSmithKline applied for FDA approval for NovaMin, a spokesperson for the company said, “GSK Consumer Healthcare is unable to answer this question due to scientific research and commercial strategy confidentiality.” The spokesperson also added that “toothpaste with NovaMin and without fluoride has been cleared by FDA as a medical device for in-office use.”\n\nAn FDA spokesperson also weighed in, saying, “We cannot comment on why a product is not approved in the U.S. The company would need to discuss their marketing.”\n\nThere are a number of reasons — economic, social, technological, ecological, and legal — why a company might introduce a product in one market, but not another. But the company’s tight-lipped explanation has fueled speculation, and conspiracy theories, around the absence of Sensodyne Repair & Protect with NovaMin from the U.S. shelves.\n\nOne theory  claims GSK is in the pocket of “Big Dental.” In turn, the company is withholding NovaMin so that consumers have to pay for more expensive in-office procedures. Another  theory argues that the FDA approved NovaMin for use in over the counter toothpaste, but had qualms with the term “Repair” in the name of the product.\n\n“GSK couldn’t market the ‘Repair’ part because bioglass isn’t really repairing the enamel, just protecting it beyond fluoride,” says Leo. In a December 2016 post on Reddit’s Q&A section r/IamA, a technician claiming to work  in a toothpaste factory repeated the theory.\n\n“NovaMin didn’t make it into U.S. markets due to regulatory obstacles, though my guess is Sensodyne/GSK is working on that. Making the label claim that the toothpaste restores enamel will really challenge the way toothpaste is currently registered/regulated by the FDA whereas the MHRA in the EU is very relaxed on toothpaste,” said user PasteGuy. (PasteGuy’s identity was not verified.)\n\nLeo notes that at different times, Burt’s Bees and Dr. Collins both sold toothpaste products that contained the NovaMin compound under it’s nonbranded name, calcium sodium phosphosilicate.

I love meeting new people. As a result, I have been very fortunate to build an extensive network. The older I get, the more I realize how much this network has helped me get to where I am today. People underestimate the value of networking in their success. Most would say absolute success (vs. relative success) is the result of a combination of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-success-come-mostly-from-talent-hard-work-mdash-or-luck/">talent, hard work and luck</a>. If you don’t have any talent, you are unlikely to offer anything of value to others. If you don’t work hard, you can’t hone your talent and build something of value. And even if you have all the talent in the world and you work non-stop, you need luck to get you exposure and opportunity. I would add that building the right network can increase your odds of success. In other words, <strong>you can create your own luck when you have a strong network.</strong></p><p>I was inspired to write this post after coming across this article <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hollywood-before-social-media-killed-stars-nightlife-1172719">Before Social Media Killed Hollywood Nightlife</a> in the Hollywood Reporter. I was fascinated by seeing all of these young actors cavorting in L.A. clubs before they became famous celebrities. I wondered how many were already famous before these photos were taken and most were still unknowns at the time (circa 2001). You can see a photo of a young <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0597388/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">Jason Momoa</a> ten years prior to his breakout role as Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones and now the billion dollar Aquaman. There’s a photo of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424060/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Scarlett Johansson</a> who wouldn’t have her breakout role in Lost in Translation until 2003. It would make sense if they were already celebrities that they would run in the same social circles, but that was not the case. It seems like too much of a coincidence that so many of the photos show so many young actors and actresses together before they made it. Obviously these are selective photos and there are probably dozens of others with people who didn’t make it big, but the fact remains that these future Oscar-winners and blockbuster movie stars were connected before they were famous. One must wonder to what degree they helped one another get there along the way through introductions and access.</p><figure><figcaption>Punani Thursdays at The Lounge in the early 2000s drew (from left) Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Gwen Stefani, now-cryptocurrency entrepreneur Les Borsai and, crouching, actor Taj Johnson. Source: Pantera Sarah</figcaption></figure><p>Just the other day, I was visiting the Gauguin exhibit at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco. I noticed that <a href="https://www.gauguingallery.com/pissarros-influence-on-gauguin.aspx">Paul Gauguin was friends with Camille Pissarro</a> and it struck me how many of the masters were socially acquainted. I always thought that it was an odd coincidence that the great Impressionists were all friends (and they were most definitely not already famous at the time). In fact, most of them were rejects of the prestigious Paris Salon and were forced to exhibit their work at the Salon des Refusés (French for exhibition of rejects) in 1863. Paul Cézanne briefly attended the Atelier Suisse with Camille Pissarro and in 1862 became lifelong friends with Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet. In 1894, he visited Monet in Giverny who introduced Cézanne to Auguste Rodin and critic Gustave Geffroy. Once again, it clearly is too much of a coincidence that all of these great artists knew one another before they became famous. A week after I saw the exhibit I came upon this timely article: <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-artists-famous-friends-originality-work">Artists Become Famous through Their Friends, Not the Originality of Their Work</a>. This <a href="https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/inventingabstraction/?page=connections">interactive network diagram</a> from the MoMa demonstrates the power of connections with Wassily Kandinsky and Pablo Picasso in the center. The study performed by Columbia Business School professor Paul Ingram and his colleague Mitali Banerjee, of HEC Paris, found that “artists with a large and diverse network of contacts were most likely to be famous, regardless of how creative their art was…Specifically, the greatest predictor of fame for an artist was having a network of contacts from various countries.”</p><figure><figcaption>Andy Warhol, Photograph of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Bryan Ferry, Julian Schnabel, Jacqueline Beaurang, Paige Powell, and others at a party Julian Schnabel’s Apartment. Hedges Projects</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously it’s hard to know whether these groups of friends would go on to succeed the way they did, but they clearly were talented. All of this assumes a minimum base level of talent in order to succeed or even be accepted into the network. I dreamed of being the first Asian-American NBA star as a ten year-old. But it wouldn’t have mattered how many NBA scouts, GMs or owners I knew, because I didn’t have the physical talent or basketball IQ to be Jeremy Lin (although I did have a mean jump shot). The point is that in order to improve your chances of success, you need to invest in your network. <strong>Your network can grant you access to opportunities</strong>.</p><h3>I am Not Throwing Away My Shot</h3><p>You still need talent to succeed, but a lot of people are talented. Your network helps you break out by giving you a chance. If you look at the works of the great masters and objectively compare them to other artists of that time that did not become famous, I doubt you would really be able to tell the difference. There are many actors or singers who are just as talented as those who are celebrities, but they just never got their shot. Platforms like YouTube have somewhat leveled the playing field. You can go on YouTube and find tens of thousands of amazing voices and because of the disintermediation of record labels, more unknowns who didn’t previously have access or a network have <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube">managed to break out</a> (Justin Bieber, Alessia Cara, Shawn Mendes, etc.).</p></div><div><figure><figcaption>The PayPal Mafia. Credit: Robyn Twomey/Redux</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>In the world of startups, your network grants you access to capital, talent, partnerships and much more. Access gives you a leg up on your competition and helps you win. Social capital leads to human capital and financial capital. When you know the right people you can recruit the best talent through your network and you can get in front of the best investors. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-paypal-mafia-the-richest-group-of-men-in-silicon-valley-2014-9">The PayPal Mafia</a> is the prime example of the power of your network. Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim were all at PayPal before starting YouTube which was funded by Sequoia partner Roelof Botha who was also at PayPal. Jeremy Stoppelman started Yelp with Russel Simmons and was funded by Max Levchin, all PayPal alumni. Yes, individually they were all talented and had the potential to succeed, but having those critical relationships improved their odds.</p><p>As an early employee at Yahoo!, I was fortunate enough to know many of those who went on to do amazing things. My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/albertlee">Albert Lee</a> was a fellow product manager who went on to build <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">MyFitnessPal</a> into a $500 million company and raised money from <a href="https://www.accel.com/team/andrew-braccia">Andrew Braccia</a>, who was in business development with us at Yahoo! long before he became the influential partner at <a href="https://www.accel.com/">Accel</a> that went on to invest in Slack, Etsy, HotelTonight, 99Designs and Braintree. Albert is now an investor in my company Pared. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/silicon-valley-network-mafias.html">next generation of mafias</a> are coming out of the unicorns of Uber and AirBnb as some graduate to the venture world and others become founders that they invest in. Powerful networks such as Y Combinator, a handful of MBA programs and premium portfolios such as First Round Capital are force multipliers for these networks.</p><p>Networks grant access. Access increases opportunities. Capitalizing on opportunities leads to success. Timing and talent are important factors, but having the right network to leverage when you need it vastly improves your probability of success. In other words, like in surfing, you have to be in the right position to catch the big wave when it comes. Your network sets you up to take advantage of that wave instead of being behind and desperately paddling to catch up it.</p><h3>How to Build Your Network</h3><p>There are no shortcuts to building a strong network. You can add all of the random connections on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn and your network could still be worthless. A network is only as strong as the individual relationships and connections you have. If you only have weak ties, it’s unlikely you will be able to leverage them in a time of need. In other words, <strong>quality &gt; quantity</strong>. The Silicon Valley mafias exist because those people went to war together in the trenches. They created strong bonds through good times and bad while building startups into empires. Not everyone can have that type of shared experience, but there are other ways you can build your network with authentic connections:</p><h4>Create Value for Others</h4><p>People want to connect with you if you have something of value to offer. This is where the talent comes into play, because hopefully you have something to offer! This doesn’t have to be monetary or physical, it could be your expertise or access to your network. I get requests for introductions from friends and acquaintances all of the time because they see I’m connected to someone. I also get requests to meet up to give advice on building startups, growth marketing, fundraising, hiring and other insights from my personal experience. One way to amplify your expertise and value to others who are not in your sphere of influence is to blog or write thought leadership pieces (like this one!). If you can prove your content is worthy of the validation of the masses, people will ask you to speak on panels and do podcast interviews and more. This will continue to expand the audience who find value in your ideas. I recently wrote <a href="https://hackernoon.com/not-all-marketplaces-are-created-equal-tales-of-a-marketplace-founder-9fc0fb802706">one Medium post</a> about marketplaces that went viral and it was shared by influencers and people I respect but never interacted with before. The post led to new incredibly valuable relationships. <strong>When you create value for others, people will want to connect with you which will in turn increase the size and value of your network = Flywheel.</strong></p><h4>Stay Connected</h4><p>Add people on LinkedIn because it is how other people will find value in your network. I get requests for introductions all the time to people I’m connected to. I only accept invitations or connections to people I’ve actually interacted with. That way I can always reference that interaction or how we met when reaching back out again, even if it was years ago. Don’t randomly accept all of the spammy invites you get from people wanting to connect because “I came across your profile and wanted to connect!” Ignore. You will only dilute your network if you accept random connections. When someone in the future asks you for an introduction to someone and you have no context or idea how you’re connected, it will be very awkward to say you don’t really know them. People use LinkedIn to measure the value of your network as a reflection of you. They subconsciously signal off of how many mutual connections you have and the quality of those connections. I’m not saying it’s a perfect proxy for someone’s talent or ability, but people use whatever cues they have to evaluate others worth, and your network is one of them.</p><figure><figcaption>At least put a little effort into it.</figcaption></figure><h4>Never Be Afraid to Ask</h4><p>Not many people know this, but I’ve been friends with Guy Kawasaki for years. I was starting my first company at the time and was so inspired by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Start-Time-Tested-Battle-Hardened-Starting/dp/1591840562/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=the+art+of+the+start&amp;qid=1552536329&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3">The Art of the Start</a> that I decided to cold e-mail him for his advice. He actually responded and we had breakfast a week later. Over the years, we would get together and talk about social media and marketing. Guy is one of the best in the business of building a personal brand and I’ve learned so much from him. I would never have benefited from all of his sage wisdom if I hadn’t e-mailed him. Never be afraid to reach out to someone, because the worst response you can get is a “no” or no response at all. You shouldn’t take it personally because anyone worth getting to know is probably very busy. I can almost guarantee you that if you reach out to a busy CEO or influencer with a personalized e-mail about their product/service, book, essay, or speech that they will at the very least take the time to write a response. They might even respond with an invitation to have breakfast with them.</p><h4>Don’t Limit Yourself to One Network or Domain</h4><p>If you always socialize in the same circles, you will never expand your network. Seeing the same people regularly either because of shared industry, interests or geography limits the new relationships you can make. Spend time fostering relationships in different domains and industries. Andrew Chau, the founder of Boba Guys, is quite possibly one of the most well-connected people I know. Andrew has invested time and energy in building bridges across industries from food to politics to entertainment to fashion to sports to tech. His network is extremely valuable to many because its reach extends across the country and around the globe. By crossing over into different industries, he multiplies the number of other supernodes he is connected to which amplifies his network. The thing is, Andrew rarely asks for anything, he is always giving and creating value for others. Oftentimes this value comes from his connections and access. In other words, his network helps him create value for his network (very meta). He also happens to be an ingenious marketer who is deeply plugged in to cultural trends.</p><h4>Always Be Supportive</h4><p>Everyone appreciates it when you support them in their efforts no matter how much. If someone is launching a product, tweet about it or share it with your network. If someone is fundraising ask if you can be helpful with introductions. If someone has successfully fundraised, congratulate them publicly. If someone has news to share, help them share it to a wider audience. No matter who you are, when you have something you’re trying to promote, you will always appreciate those who support you in your endeavors. Whenever I publish a new essay on Medium, I’m always thankful to those who retweet it or share it because it drives more traffic and readership.</p><h4>Say Yes and Don’t Expect Anything in Return</h4><p>Be generous with your time. Your time is valuable, but if you only do things because you’ll selfishly get something out of it, then you will often end up being disappointed. I am very intentional about being open to helping others. I don’t help them because I expect anything in return, I do it because I can. Pay it forward. If I can help someone else with my expertise or network, then why wouldn’t I meet with them? This openness has paid back dividends tenfold in what I’ve spent in time. People I’ve helped along the way have made incredibly valuable introductions, asked me to be an advisor, and have given me critical advice in return. Those who believe in karma can relate to this. Obviously you only have so many hours in the day so you can’t always be responsive, but you can always be open.</p><h4>Be Proactive and Connect Others</h4><p>When you have an extensive network, you will have a lot of opportunities to connect people who would otherwise not intersect. As a node, you will be the only one who can see the valuable potential between two of your friends. Whether you’re connecting a founder to an investor or a customer to a buyer, there are countless reasons to bring two people together. Malcolm Gladwell refers to these natural hubs and human supernodes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference-ebook/dp/B000OT8GD0">The Tipping Point</a> as “connectors”. By creating opportunities for others, people will be extremely grateful and may potentially return the favor down the road. Got rejected by Y Combinator or Stanford Business School? Start a force multiplying community of your own. Bring like-minded people together whether it be online or offline. When others see that you are a connector, they will refer more people to you and the group. Before you know it, you will have created a valuable network for yourself and more importantly for others.</p><figure><figcaption>Hunter Walk knows a lot of good people and is a proactive connector.</figcaption></figure><p>I hate “networking” as much as the next person. When I see a someone superficially schmoozing, I roll my eyes too. People can generally tell when someone is trying too hard and clearly just want something. The people with the strongest networks are the ones who build real relationships because those are the ties that you can count on. Friends always ask me how I know so many people. My superpower is that I have a somewhat photographic memory for faces which helps me to remember people, although this has declined with age. I could remember someone I met only briefly over twenty years ago or see a photo of someone and remember the context (this has definitely freaked people out). This has obviously been a powerful gift when building my network, but it’s more important that I remember the things that matter to people I meet because I care enough to remember. Be yourself. Be authentic. If you genuinely care about people, they will sense that. <strong>Invest generously in others and you will see returns for a lifetime.</strong></p><p>If you enjoyed this post, please check out some of my other Medium articles:</p><figure><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/swlh"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*YqDjlKFwScoQYQ62DWEdig.png"></a></p></div></figure><h4>This story is published in <a href="https://medium.com/swlh">The Startup</a>, Medium’s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +439,678 people.</h4><h4>Subscribe to receive <a href="https://growthsupply.com/the-startup-newsletter/">our top stories here</a>.</h4><figure><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/swlh"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ouK9XR4xuNWtCes-TIUNAw.png"></a></p></div></figure></div></div></div></div>',
      ssml: '<speak><p>Your Network Determines Success More than You Realize.</p><break time="500ms" /><p>I am an extrovert. I love meeting new people. As a result, I have been very fortunate to build an extensive network. The older I get, the more I realize how much this network has helped me get to where I am today. People underestimate the value of networking in their success. Most would say absolute success (vs. relative success) is the result of a combination of talent, hard work and luck. If you don’t have any talent, you are unlikely to offer anything of value to others. If you don’t work hard, you can’t hone your talent and build something of value. And even if you have all the talent in the world and you work non-stop, you need luck to get you exposure and opportunity. I would add that building the right network can increase your odds of success. In other words, you can create your own luck when you have a strong network.</p><p>I was inspired to write this post after coming across this article Before Social Media Killed Hollywood Nightlife in the Hollywood Reporter. I was fascinated by seeing all of these young actors cavorting in L.A. clubs before they became famous celebrities. I wondered how many were already famous before these photos were taken and most were still unknowns at the time (circa 2001). You can see a photo of a young Jason Momoa ten years prior to his breakout role as Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones and now the billion dollar Aquaman. There’s a photo of Scarlett Johansson who wouldn’t have her breakout role in Lost in Translation until 2003. It would make sense if they were already celebrities that they would run in the same social circles, but that was not the case. It seems like too much of a coincidence that so many of the photos show so many young actors and actresses together before they made it. Obviously these are selective photos and there are probably dozens of others with people who didn’t make it big, but the fact remains that these future Oscar-winners and blockbuster movie stars were connected before they were famous. One must wonder to what degree they helped one another get there along the way through introductions and access.</p><p>Just the other day, I was visiting the Gauguin exhibit at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco. I noticed that Paul Gauguin was friends with Camille Pissarro and it struck me how many of the masters were socially acquainted. I always thought that it was an odd coincidence that the great Impressionists were all friends (and they were most definitely not already famous at the time). In fact, most of them were rejects of the prestigious Paris Salon and were forced to exhibit their work at the Salon des Refusés (French for exhibition of rejects) in 1863. Paul Cézanne briefly attended the Atelier Suisse with Camille Pissarro and in 1862 became lifelong friends with Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet. In 1894, he visited Monet in Giverny who introduced Cézanne to Auguste Rodin and critic Gustave Geffroy. Once again, it clearly is too much of a coincidence that all of these great artists knew one another before they became famous. A week after I saw the exhibit I came upon this timely article: Artists Become Famous through Their Friends, Not the Originality of Their Work. This interactive network diagram from the MoMa demonstrates the power of connections with Wassily Kandinsky and Pablo Picasso in the center. The study performed by Columbia Business School professor Paul Ingram and his colleague Mitali Banerjee, of HEC Paris, found that “artists with a large and diverse network of contacts were most likely to be famous, regardless of how creative their art was…Specifically, the greatest predictor of fame for an artist was having a network of contacts from various countries.”</p><p>Obviously it’s hard to know whether these groups of friends would go on to succeed the way they did, but they clearly were talented. All of this assumes a minimum base level of talent in order to succeed or even be accepted into the network. I dreamed of being the first Asian-American NBA star as a ten year-old. But it wouldn’t have mattered how many NBA scouts, GMs or owners I knew, because I didn’t have the physical talent or basketball IQ to be Jeremy Lin (although I did have a mean jump shot). The point is that in order to improve your chances of success, you need to invest in your network. Your network can grant you access to opportunities.</p><p>I am Not Throwing Away My Shot<break time="1s" />.</p><p>You still need talent to succeed, but a lot of people are talented. Your network helps you break out by giving you a chance. If you look at the works of the great masters and objectively compare them to other artists of that time that did not become famous, I doubt you would really be able to tell the difference. There are many actors or singers who are just as talented as those who are celebrities, but they just never got their shot. Platforms like YouTube have somewhat leveled the playing field. You can go on YouTube and find tens of thousands of amazing voices and because of the disintermediation of record labels, more unknowns who didn’t previously have access or a network have managed to break out (Justin Bieber, Alessia Cara, Shawn Mendes, etc.).</p><p>In the world of startups, your network grants you access to capital, talent, partnerships and much more. Access gives you a leg up on your competition and helps you win. Social capital leads to human capital and financial capital. When you know the right people you can recruit the best talent through your network and you can get in front of the best investors. The PayPal Mafia is the prime example of the power of your network. Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim were all at PayPal before starting YouTube which was funded by Sequoia partner Roelof Botha who was also at PayPal. Jeremy Stoppelman started Yelp with Russel Simmons and was funded by Max Levchin, all PayPal alumni. Yes, individually they were all talented and had the potential to succeed, but having those critical relationships improved their odds.</p><p>As an early employee at Yahoo!, I was fortunate enough to know many of those who went on to do amazing things. My friend Albert Lee was a fellow product manager who went on to build MyFitnessPal into a $500 million company and raised money from Andrew Braccia, who was in business development with us at Yahoo! long before he became the influential partner at Accel that went on to invest in Slack, Etsy, HotelTonight, 99Designs and Braintree. Albert is now an investor in my company Pared. The next generation of mafias are coming out of the unicorns of Uber and AirBnb as some graduate to the venture world and others become founders that they invest in. Powerful networks such as Y Combinator, a handful of MBA programs and premium portfolios such as First Round Capital are force multipliers for these networks.</p><p>Networks grant access. Access increases opportunities. Capitalizing on opportunities leads to success. Timing and talent are important factors, but having the right network to leverage when you need it vastly improves your probability of success. In other words, like in surfing, you have to be in the right position to catch the big wave when it comes. Your network sets you up to take advantage of that wave instead of being behind and desperately paddling to catch up it.</p><p>How to Build Your Network<break time="1s" />.</p><p>There are no shortcuts to building a strong network. You can add all of the random connections on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn and your network could still be worthless. A network is only as strong as the individual relationships and connections you have. If you only have weak ties, it’s unlikely you will be able to leverage them in a time of need. In other words, quality &gt; quantity. The Silicon Valley mafias exist because those people went to war together in the trenches. They created strong bonds through good times and bad while building startups into empires. Not everyone can have that type of shared experience, but there are other ways you can build your network with authentic connections:</p><p>Create Value for Others<break time="1s" />.</p><p>People want to connect with you if you have something of value to offer. This is where the talent comes into play, because hopefully you have something to offer! This doesn’t have to be monetary or physical, it could be your expertise or access to your network. I get requests for introductions from friends and acquaintances all of the time because they see I’m connected to someone. I also get requests to meet up to give advice on building startups, growth marketing, fundraising, hiring and other insights from my personal experience. One way to amplify your expertise and value to others who are not in your sphere of influence is to blog or write thought leadership pieces (like this one!). If you can prove your content is worthy of the validation of the masses, people will ask you to speak on panels and do podcast interviews and more. This will continue to expand the audience who find value in your ideas. I recently wrote one Medium post about marketplaces that went viral and it was shared by influencers and people I respect but never interacted with before. The post led to new incredibly valuable relationships. When you create value for others, people will want to connect with you which will in turn increase the size and value of your network = Flywheel.</p><p>Stay Connected<break time="1s" />.</p><p>Add people on LinkedIn because it is how other people will find value in your network.

I can almost guarantee you that if you reach out to a busy CEO or influencer with a personalized e-mail about their product/service, book, essay, or speech that they will at the very least take the time to write a response. They might even respond with an invitation to have breakfast with them.\n\nDON’T LIMIT YOURSELF TO ONE NETWORK OR DOMAIN\nIf you always socialize in the same circles, you will never expand your network. Seeing the same people regularly either because of shared industry, interests or geography limits the new relationships you can make. Spend time fostering relationships in different domains and industries. Andrew Chau, the founder of Boba Guys, is quite possibly one of the most well-connected people I know. Andrew has invested time and energy in building bridges across industries from food to politics to entertainment to fashion to sports to tech. His network is extremely valuable to many because its reach extends across the country and around the globe. By crossing over into different industries, he multiplies the number of other supernodes he is connected to which amplifies his network. The thing is, Andrew rarely asks for anything, he is always giving and creating value for others. Oftentimes this value comes from his connections and access. In other words, his network helps him create value for his network (very meta). He also happens to be an ingenious marketer who is deeply plugged in to cultural trends.\n\nALWAYS BE SUPPORTIVE\nEveryone appreciates it when you support them in their efforts no matter how much. If someone is launching a product, tweet about it or share it with your network. If someone is fundraising ask if you can be helpful with introductions. If someone has successfully fundraised, congratulate them publicly. If someone has news to share, help them share it to a wider audience. No matter who you are, when you have something you’re trying to promote, you will always appreciate those who support you in your endeavors. Whenever I publish a new essay on Medium, I’m always thankful to those who retweet it or share it because it drives more traffic and readership.\n\nSAY YES AND DON’T EXPECT ANYTHING IN RETURN\nBe generous with your time. Your time is valuable, but if you only do things because you’ll selfishly get something out of it, then you will often end up being disappointed. I am very intentional about being open to helping others. I don’t help them because I expect anything in return, I do it because I can. Pay it forward. If I can help someone else with my expertise or network, then why wouldn’t I meet with them? This openness has paid back dividends tenfold in what I’ve spent in time. People I’ve helped along the way have made incredibly valuable introductions, asked me to be an advisor, and have given me critical advice in return. Those who believe in karma can relate to this. Obviously you only have so many hours in the day so you can’t always be responsive, but you can always be open.\n\nBE PROACTIVE AND CONNECT OTHERS\nWhen you have an extensive network, you will have a lot of opportunities to connect people who would otherwise not intersect. As a node, you will be the only one who can see the valuable potential between two of your friends. Whether you’re connecting a founder to an investor or a customer to a buyer, there are countless reasons to bring two people together. Malcolm Gladwell refers to these natural hubs and human supernodes in The Tipping Point  as “connectors”. By creating opportunities for others, people will be extremely grateful and may potentially return the favor down the road. Got rejected by Y Combinator or Stanford Business School? Start a force multiplying community of your own. Bring like-minded people together whether it be online or offline. When others see that you are a connector, they will refer more people to you and the group. Before you know it, you will have created a valuable network for yourself and more importantly for others.\n\nI hate “networking” as much as the next person. When I see a someone superficially schmoozing, I roll my eyes too. People can generally tell when someone is trying too hard and clearly just want something. The people with the strongest networks are the ones who build real relationships because those are the ties that you can count on. Friends always ask me how I know so many people. My superpower is that I have a somewhat photographic memory for faces which helps me to remember people, although this has declined with age. I could remember someone I met only briefly over twenty years ago or see a photo of someone and remember the context (this has definitely freaked people out). This has obviously been a powerful gift when building my network, but it’s more important that I remember the things that matter to people I meet because I care enough to remember. Be yourself. Be authentic. If you genuinely care about people, they will sense that. Invest generously in others and you will see returns for a lifetime.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, please check out some of my other Medium articles:\n\nTHIS STORY IS PUBLISHED IN THE STARTUP , MEDIUM’S LARGEST ENTREPRENEURSHIP PUBLICATION FOLLOWED BY +439,678 PEOPLE.\nSUBSCRIBE TO RECEIVE OUR TOP STORIES HERE .',

running an obstacle race. It’s a never-ending path of obstacles from start to finish. The struggle is inevitable, but the way you frame your setbacks is completely up to you and&nbsp;the way you make decisions to overcome them may be the very thing that helps you succeed.</p><p name="29a3" id="29a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s human nature to avoid pain and seek pleasure, but entrepreneurs are always on a different level than the rest. They take risks where others play it safe. They fend off comfort zones in the name of progress, even when it means potential failure.</p><p name="011d" id="011d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the path isn’t an easy road, and the&nbsp;survival rate for startups&nbsp;is low. Talent, knowledge, skills, and experience may be building blocks of success, but often it’s the mental ability of the individual that drives them ahead. The process of adapting well in the face of adversity is a valuable quality for those looking to start or grow a business.</p><p name="5c52" id="5c52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For entrepreneurs, the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties is about rethinking the way you see setbacks and viewing them as catalysts of growth and progress rather than threats. Because the truth is, obstacles help you grow as a person when you’re faced with extremely difficult problems and decisions.</p><p name="fcd3" id="fcd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having this ability is crucial if you want your business and your career as an entrepreneur to grow and last. Like any shift in thinking, it doesn’t happen overnight, but there are practical steps you can take immediately to build quick decision-making skills and become better equipped to handle setbacks as you start and grow your business. Setbacks are unavoidable, and they’re not pleasant, but they also have the potential to be your engine of personal growth.</p><p name="a6e3" id="a6e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Startups face all sorts of challenges that relate to market, hiring, product, funding, and customer service. There’s no shortage of setbacks you could run into. To build quick decision making skills to overcome obstacles, firstly you will need to rethink what appears to be negative: a&nbsp;failed business, a failed product launch, an app that none downloads and realizing that, is actually helpful for future growth and success.</p><p name="ce75" id="ce75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An entrepreneur looks past short-term setbacks and focuses on long-term goals. The unadaptable entrepreneur gets caught up in temporary problems; they can’t see through, so it’s easier to quit or get distracted, to work on something else rather than to face the blunt facts of their situation. The difference between success and failure often comes down to who’s&nbsp;willing to stick it out&nbsp;in the smartest way, and that’s not necessarily related to talent, skill or education. That’s how you develop skills to overcome any obstacles that may be ahead of you during your entrepreneurial career.</p><p name="f2c4" id="f2c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is that those with quick decision-making skills and a positive attitude often have an easier time facing challenges, simply because they’ll be less likely to give up quickly. They’ll be steadfast. Facing obstacles head on can translate to finding solutions more quickly, because you’re not avoiding or ignoring the unpleasant facts before you.</p><p name="bc3e" id="bc3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Resilience keeps a successful entrepreneur moving even when you can’t see the finish line.&nbsp;Resilience&nbsp;is what measures your success. It’s what makes a good entrepreneur.&nbsp;Resourcefulness and optimism help entrepreneurs to catapult their business over that distant horizons. Resilience predicts your success, it’s one of the most important factors in an entrepreneur’s life.</p><p name="78b4" id="78b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It isn’t only about getting your company off the ground – sometimes it benefits you when you’ve failed and you’re ready to start again. Entrepreneurs who are starting their second business after an initial, failed attempt are significantly more likely to find success in their second company. If you’re resilient, the odds are&nbsp;in your favor. If you’re an entrepreneur, you know how important it is to have&nbsp;people believe&nbsp;in you. Whether it’s the CEO of a company, an influencer who could boost your career to new places or a potential investor – people need to believe in you. They want to see your potential in order to invest in your startup. But they’re relying on you to tell them what you can do – so if you don’t believe it, neither will anyone else. If your confidence level falls just before a meeting, trust your interviewer to notice your resilience, which might make the difference between making or breaking the deal.</p><p name="8505" id="8505" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So, if you’re an entrepreneur, be resilient to overcome any obstacles that may be ahead of you during your career.</p></div></div></section><section

      text: 'Starting a business is like running an obstacle race. It’s a neverending path of obstacles from start to finish. The struggle is inevitable, but the way you frame your setbacks is completely up to you and the way you make decisions to overcome them may be the very thing that helps you succeed.\n\nIt’s human nature to avoid pain and seek pleasure, but entrepreneurs are always on a different level than the rest. They take risks where others play it safe. They fend off comfort zones in the name of progress, even when it means potential failure.\n\nBut the path isn’t an easy road, and the survival rate for startups is low. Talent, knowledge, skills, and experience may be building blocks of success, but often it’s the mental ability of the individual that drives them ahead. The process of adapting well in the face of adversity is a valuable quality for those looking to start or grow a business.\n\nFor entrepreneurs, the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties is about rethinking the way you see setbacks and viewing them as catalysts of growth and progress rather than threats. Because the truth is, obstacles help you grow as a person when you’re faced with extremely difficult problems and decisions.\n\nHaving this ability is crucial if you want your business and your career as an entrepreneur to grow and last. Like any shift in thinking, it doesn’t happen overnight, but there are practical steps you can take immediately to build quick decisionmaking skills and become better equipped to handle setbacks as you start and grow your business.

With actual dollars.</p><p>I’m going to be nuanced on this one because I used to do something similar. In fact, it’s pretty common. At the very beginning of the startup cycle, unless the founder is independently wealthy or incredibly risk-tolerant or enviably well-connected, there’s no money and no one is getting paid.</p><p>It’s very difficult and time consuming to get an idea into reality on one’s own. It takes a broad skill set, a lot of iterative work, and a bunch of lucky breaks for one person to create a minimum viable product, validate it, and start generating revenue from it. Invariably, that single individual will need help, and if there’s no money and no access to it, they will need an alternative means of remuneration.</p><p>That alternative is usually promises. And promises in startup are always, <em>always</em> a bridge built to burn.</p><h4>“I’m losing them.”</h4><p>Yesterday, I got an <a href="https://www.joeprocopio.com/#help">email via my website</a> from “Chad,” a founder working on a new startup with volunteers for staff. He admits straight up that the lack of pay is due to his own lack of funds, but he’s looking forward to paying them all a salary as soon as possible.</p><p>The problem is, as Chad puts it, their productivity has fallen off despite the promise of wages down the road. He puts this on himself and his lack of leadership. What does he do?</p><p>Oof. Chad. Buddy. I think you skipped a bunch of steps.</p><h4>First things first: Nothing is free</h4><p>We founders need to understand that nothing in startup comes without a cost. Nothing. I went to great lengths a few weeks ago to drive this point home and put some quantification around it with a post called <a href="https://medium.com/@jproco/you-need-250-000-to-start-a-company-886298e8cf7e?source=friends_link&amp;sk=9fbcc16a6994db38cf8ddfc99c31111b">You Need $250,000 To Start a Company</a>.</p><p>I had detractors, of course, but I stand behind my point 100%. No matter how we pay for it — with sweat equity, paper equity, time, cash, or opportunity cost — we’re going to end up spending the equivalent of about a quarter-million to turn an idea into something that can sustain itself. Even if those costs are hidden or, more to the point, obfuscated.</p><p>Yeah, if we’re making promises to volunteers, all we’re doing is slyly shifting some of our costs to them and/or the future.</p><p>So the first question a founder needs to ask themselves is this: If we’re not willing to raise, find, beg, borrow, or steal cash to pay other people to turn our idea into a reality, then how much do we believe in our idea?</p><p>If the answer is still “very much,” then let’s cautiously look at those alternatives.</p><h4>Selling the future</h4><p>The first go-to alternative is equity, and that’s always a thorny issue. There are a lot of ways to screw up the distribution of equity in the first days of startup, but they all have the same root cause. Here are just a few of those problems:</p><p>Problem #1: The founder hands out too much equity to employees too early, leaving very little for investors to purchase with real money.</p><p>Problem #2: The founder doesn’t vest the employee equity, meaning the employees own a chunk of the company on their first day, even if they leave or get arrested or harass someone.</p><p>Problem #3: The founder hands out 1,000 or 1,000,000 shares and nobody knows what that means, including the founder.</p><p>All these problems start with the founder not properly valuing the equity from the beginning.</p><p>Make your own jokes about how much early stage startup equity is worth in relation to the paper it isn’t even printed on anymore. The fact is the reverse is always true. When we use equity as compensation, we’re selling the future of the company and we’re painting ourselves into a corner in terms of both dollars and time.</p><p>Always decide how much the future value of those options is worth, always vest them over three years, and always explain to the employee what percentage of the company they’re getting and where we think the value will be at the end of the vesting period.</p><p>Also, we shouldn’t expect an employee to put in $250,000 worth of work for $250,000 worth of equity. They’d be an idiot if they did that. We’re looking at a ratio, could be 10 to 1, could be 100 to 1, and this is where the next factor comes into play.</p><h4>Passion and risk</h4><p>When we ask people to work for free, we’re really just spending passion to pay for risk.</p><p>People will go to great lengths to help something succeed that they’re passionate about. This is the true root of volunteerism. If we believe in something, we’ll do just about anything for it.</p><p>So in order to get people to work for us for free, they need to:</p><ol><li>Believe in the idea.</li><li>Believe in the founder.</li><li>Believe in the process.</li></ol><p>We tap that passion to overcome these risks:</p><ol><li>Ideas have no value on their own. They are simply a means to an end. The best idea is world peace. I believe in that. I’m also a realist.</li><li>No one has the magic formula for startup. No one. It’s very Catch-22 that the most successful founders are the ones who least need free labor. There’s a reason for that.</li><li>This has never been done before.</li></ol><p>While the idea and the founder are somewhat static risks, the last risk, the process to get the idea to successful product, is one that needs continuous mitigation. This is where Chad is losing the motivation and the productivity of his volunteers. They’re losing faith in the process.</p><h4>Transparency and timeline</h4><p>From the very first pitch to the prospective free employee to the moment we cut them their first salary check, we need to sell them on the idea that the process will work. There’s a right way and a wrong way to do that, and if we take advantage of people, it’s going to come back on us.</p><p>The wrong way can lead to the incredible scamminess we’ll find in something like Fyre Fest or Theranos. (Most) People wanted those things to succeed for the right reasons: For the former, an immersive and interactive social experience, and for the latter, inexpensive and less-invasive blood testing. The founders then preyed on those ideals to obtain products, services, and money with zero or deferred remuneration.</p><p>This isn’t every startup, obviously, but the bullet points are there. What happens is vague promises get made. Then inevitably one party claims those promises got broken while the other party either parses the promise or denies the promise ever got made.</p><p>The right way to employ free labor is with transparency and on a timeline.</p><p>The issue with free labor is rarely the lack of pay, it’s <em>how long</em> the labor goes without pay. This is because most free labor is acquired during the heady, exciting early days with the promise of “We’ll figure it out later.”</p><p>Yeah, don’t do that.</p><p>Transparency happens in writing, explaining what the expectations are for their output and how much time we need from them on a weekly basis. We should also be clear about where they fit in the company’s eventual hierarchy. Are they a co-founder? Are they a C-Suite employee? Will they be?</p><p>A clear definition of the value of any non-cash compensation as described above is also a must. And then finally it should be noted how much money the founder has or has access to and what that money is going to be used for.</p><p>A timeline should be laid out that explains, at a minimum, the events that need to happen for the employee to start getting paid, what kind of schedule might be used to get that pay up to something decent, and how long we believe it might take.</p><p>Never make it indefinite because when we do that we’re putting the employee on a short runway alone. We need to be on that runway as well. If we can’t pay them within, say, six months, then we need to fold up and go home.</p><p>And a word of warning — when I say we need to fold up and go home, we can’t pause and start over. Imagine what happens when we lay off our free labor and then we do succeed. Those people we cut out have a case against us, and believe me they will make that case.</p><h4>Can we retro?</h4><p>So what does Chad do here? Is it possible for him to retroactively apply what we’ve laid out here and take this transparency and timeline to each of his volunteers and get them to re-up?</p><p>Absolutely it’s possible. That’s what leadership is. And I daresay that’s what’s missing. He’ll lose a bunch of them, for sure, but at this point, it’s the only right way to move his company forward unless he’s prepared to start paying everyone today.</p></div></div></div></div>',

Even if those costs are hidden or, more to the point, obfuscated.\n\nYeah, if we’re making promises to volunteers, all we’re doing is slyly shifting some of our costs to them and/or the future.\n\nSo the first question a founder needs to ask themselves is this: If we’re not willing to raise, find, beg, borrow, or steal cash to pay other people to turn our idea into a reality, then how much do we believe in our idea?\n\nIf the answer is still “very much,” then let’s cautiously look at those alternatives.\n\nSELLING THE FUTURE\nThe first go-to alternative is equity, and that’s always a thorny issue. There are a lot of ways to screw up the distribution of equity in the first days of startup, but they all have the same root cause. Here are just a few of those problems:\n\nProblem #1: The founder hands out too much equity to employees too early, leaving very little for investors to purchase with real money.\n\nProblem #2: The founder doesn’t vest the employee equity, meaning the employees own a chunk of the company on their first day, even if they leave or get arrested or harass someone.\n\nProblem #3: The founder hands out 1,000 or 1,000,000 shares and nobody knows what that means, including the founder.\n\nAll these problems start with the founder not properly valuing the equity from the beginning.\n\nMake your own jokes about how much early stage startup equity is worth in relation to the paper it isn’t even printed on anymore. The fact is the reverse is always true. When we use equity as compensation, we’re selling the future of the company and we’re painting ourselves into a corner in terms of both dollars and time.\n\nAlways decide how much the future value of those options is worth, always vest them over three years, and always explain to the employee what percentage of the company they’re getting and where we think the value will be at the end of the vesting period.\n\nAlso, we shouldn’t expect an employee to put in $250,000 worth of work for $250,000 worth of equity. They’d be an idiot if they did that. We’re looking at a ratio, could be 10 to 1, could be 100 to 1, and this is where the next factor comes into play.\n\nPASSION AND RISK\nWhen we ask people to work for free, we’re really just spending passion to pay for risk.\n\nPeople will go to great lengths to help something succeed that they’re passionate about. This is the true root of volunteerism. If we believe in something, we’ll do just about anything for it.\n\nSo in order to get people to work for us for free, they need to:\n\n 1. Believe in the idea.\n 2. Believe in the founder.\n 3. Believe in the process.\n\nWe tap that passion to overcome these risks:\n\n 1. Ideas have no value on their own. They are simply a means to an end. The best idea is world peace. I believe in that. I’m also a realist.\n 2. No one has the magic formula for startup. No one. It’s very Catch-22 that the most successful founders are the ones who least need free labor. There’s a reason for that.\n 3. This has never been done before.\n\nWhile the idea and the founder are somewhat static risks, the last risk, the process to get the idea to successful product, is one that needs continuous mitigation. This is where Chad is losing the motivation and the productivity of his volunteers. They’re losing faith in the process.\n\nTRANSPARENCY AND TIMELINE\nFrom the very first pitch to the prospective free employee to the moment we cut them their first salary check, we need to sell them on the idea that the process will work. There’s a right way and a wrong way to do that, and if we take advantage of people, it’s going to come back on us.\n\nThe wrong way can lead to the incredible scamminess we’ll find in something like Fyre Fest or Theranos. (Most) People wanted those things to succeed for the right reasons: For the former, an immersive and interactive social experience, and for the latter, inexpensive and less-invasive blood testing. The founders then preyed on those ideals to obtain products, services, and money with zero or deferred remuneration.\n\nThis isn’t every startup, obviously, but the bullet points are there. What happens is vague promises get made. Then inevitably one party claims those promises got broken while the other party either parses the promise or denies the promise ever got made.\n\nThe right way to employ free labor is with transparency and on a timeline.\n\nThe issue with free labor is rarely the lack of pay, it’s how long the labor goes without pay. This is because most free labor is acquired during the heady, exciting early days with the promise of “We’ll figure it out later.”\n\nYeah, don’t do that.\n\nTransparency happens in writing, explaining what the expectations are for their output and how much time we need from them on a weekly basis. We should also be clear about where they fit in the company’s eventual hierarchy. Are they a co-founder? Are they a C-Suite employee? Will they be?\n\nA clear definition of the value of any non-cash compensation as described above is also a must. And then finally it should be noted how much money the founder has or has access to and what that money is going to be used for.\n\nA timeline should be laid out that explains, at a minimum, the events that need to happen for the employee to start getting paid, what kind of schedule might be used to get that pay up to something decent, and how long we believe it might take.\n\nNever make it indefinite because when we do that we’re putting the employee on a short runway alone. We need to be on that runway as well. If we can’t pay them within, say, six months, then we need to fold up and go home.\n\nAnd a word of warning — when I say we need to fold up and go home, we can’t pause and start over. Imagine what happens when we lay off our free labor and then we do succeed. Those people we cut out have a case against us, and believe me they will make that case.\n\nCAN WE RETRO?\nSo what does Chad do here? Is it possible for him to retroactively apply what we’ve laid out here and take this transparency and timeline to each of his volunteers and get them to re-up?\n\nAbsolutely it’s possible. That’s what leadership is. And I daresay that’s what’s missing. He’ll lose a bunch of them, for sure, but at this point, it’s the only right way to move his company forward unless he’s prepared to start paying everyone today.',

Instead, try using your bad mood as an excuse to practice a little self-compassion.\n\n“You can’t change something — a habit, a mood, or a bad day — without acknowledging that you don’t like what’s currently happening,” Hanley says. “Even saying to yourself, ‘Wow, I’m in a bad mood,’ can be just the opening to ask yourself, ‘What do I most need right now?’”\n\nMaybe you just need a break, and you can go outside for 10 minutes at lunch instead of running an errand or eating at your desk. Hanley recommends playing your favorite music on the way home instead of listening to the news.\n\nBut to make that happen, you have to admit that you need it in the first place. Make an effort to regularly check in with yourself throughout the day for what you need in a given moment — whether it’s a glass of water or a quick walk around the block. Colan says there’s a level of mindfulness to it: “One of the key things to get through any point of adversity—even if it’s just a bad mood or rough day—you have to plan for the future but live in the present.”\n\nTaking that idea and zooming out with it, you can also use your past experience to help you: Look back at previous rough patches and see how everything ended up working out. You’ve gotten through plenty of bad moods in the past, and you’ll do it again — and reminding yourself that this is temporary may help speed the process along.',

      text: '&gt; In the working world, everyone aspires to upgrade the badge on their shirt or the title on their desk plaque.\nManager of this. Assistant manager of this. Co-assistant manager of this. Supervisor. The supervisor’s supervisor.\n\nOthers try to change the perception of their role with a new title, like Director of First Impressions (receptionist), Sandwich Technician (Subway worker) or Washroom Operatives (cleaners).\n\nEveryone seems to crave a badge of honour to prove their worth to the world.\n\nWhoop dee fucking do.\n\nWhy bother? A badge changes nothing. A new title is meaningless. Because you still won’t have respect.\n\nYour colleagues and peers will only respect you if you work hard. They will only respect you if you earn your badge.\n\n&gt; The world only takes notice if your output makes a difference.\nIN THE STARTUP WORLD, TITLES MEAN NOTHING.\nIf you start your own business, you are either everything, or nothing.\n\nI work as half of a two man team and that leaves a lot of ground to cover. Below is a list of job roles, or titles, I do or take control of in my startup.\n\n-Founder\n-Designer\n-Maker\n-On Site Installations\n-Admin\n-Financial Management\n-Social Media Management\n-Email Management\n-Client Relations\n-Viewing and Assessing Jobs\n-Pricing and Costing\n-Producing Quotes and Invoices\n-Securing Commissions / Contracts\n-Website Development and Maintenance\n-Marketing Strategy\n-Design and Production of Marketing Materials\n-All Other PR\n\n&gt; Or to put that under one, easier to understand title… I am an entrepreneur.\nAnd I wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nTHE STARTUP LEARNING CURVE\nWhen people ask “what is the most rewarding thing about starting a business”, I always give the same answer.\n\n&gt; The experiences and lessons learned in my startup journey have changed me forever.\nThe learning curve has been (is still) huge, but it has been by far the biggest gain. Every single day has presented new problems. Every new project brings fresh challenges to take on. And with every one that you achieve, you get better and better as person, and more confident in a variety of roles.\n\nSeriously, my personal development, skill set, abilities and life experience have all increased ten fold.\n\nThey have developed so much because I made the choice to take on all the roles mentioned above.\n\n&gt; We made it our mission to learn to do them ourselves.\nWe didn’t want to hire people to manage our money.\n\nWe didn’t want to hire people to run our social media accounts.\n\nWe didn’t want to send reps down to meet clients on site.\n\nWe didn’t want to hire a web developer.\n\nWe didn’t want to pay for a graphic designer to do our marketing material.\n\n&gt; We wanted to develop a brand that was personal and relatable, a brand that allowed us to form genuine relationships with clients and customers.

      html: '<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After months and months of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/04/everyone-is-talking-to-everyone-rideshare-investor-bypasses-uber-careem-rumor/">rumors</a> it’s finally been <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/">confirmed</a> that ride-hailing giant Uber is picking up its Middle East rival Careem in an acquisition deal worth $3.1 billion — with $1.7BN to be paid in convertible notes and $1.4BN in cash.</p><p><a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber">Uber </a><a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/">writes</a> that it expects the transaction to close in Q1 2020, pending applicable regulatory approvals.</p><p>It says it will acquire all of <a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/careem">Careem’s </a>mobility, delivery, and payments businesses across the greater Middle East region, which it notes ranges from Morocco to Pakistan.</p><p>Major markets for Careem are stated to include Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, with the business operating in <span>120 cities across 15 countries in total.</span></p><p>The startup has raised around $772M to date, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/careem#section-funding-rounds">Crunchbase</a>, with investors including Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holdings, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and Japanese tech giant Rakuten.</p><p>It was founded as a ride-hailing Uber rival in 2012 but has since diversified into offerings such as food and package deliver, bus services and credit transfers — bolstered via acquisitions of its own, such as RoundMenu and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/careem-india-tech-team/">Commut</a> (both announced last year).</p><p>The price-tag Uber is paying for Careem is notable for being considerably higher than recent reports of its valuation. Last fall, when Careem raised a $200M tranche of funding, the business was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-careem-funding/mideast-ride-hailing-app-careem-raises-200-million-to-expand-expects-more-funds-idUSKCN1MS0EF">reported</a> to be valued at around $2BN.</p><p>The value of the transaction also looks to be a record for a Middle Eastern tech startup exit, as well as being among the largest for a ride-hailing M&amp;A globally. (China’s Didi shelled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/didi-confirms-it-has-acquired-99-in-brazil-to-expand-in-latin-america/">$600M+</a> for Brazilian ride-hailing startup 99 at the start of last year, valuing that LatAm regional business at around $1BN, for example.)</p><p>It’s also notable for Uber aggressively stepping on the gas in a market, rather than making another <a href="https://twitter.com/jonrussell/status/1110493592529731586">strategic retreat</a>, as it has in regions such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/25/gruber-official/">Southeast Asia</a>.</p><p>Commenting on the Uber-Careem acquisition in a statement, Uber CEO <a href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dara-khosrowshahi">Dara Khosrowshahi </a>said:</p><blockquote><p>This is an important moment for Uber as we continue to expand the strength of our platform around the world. With a proven ability to develop innovative local solutions, Careem has played a key role in shaping the future of urban mobility across the Middle East, becoming one of the most successful startups in the region. Working closely with Careem’s founders, I’m confident we will deliver exceptional outcomes for riders, drivers, and cities, in this fast-moving part of the world.</p></blockquote><p>While Careem CEO and co-founder, Mudassir Sheikha had this to say in another supporting statement:</p><blockquote><p>Joining forces with Uber will help us accelerate Careem’s purpose of simplifying and improving the lives of people, and building an awesome organisation that inspires. The mobility and broader internet opportunity in the region is massive and untapped, and has the potential to leapfrog our region into the digital future. We could not have found a better partner than Uber under Dara’s leadership to realise this opportunity. This is a milestone moment for us and the region, and will serve as a catalyst for the region’s technology ecosystem by increasing the availability of resources for budding entrepreneurs from local and global investors.</p></blockquote><p>Upon closing, Careem will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Uber — and will continue to operate under its own brand, with Sheikha leading the Careem business.</p><p>Under Uber’s ownership Careem will report to its own board made up of three representatives from Uber and two representatives from Careem, Uber added.</p><p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Careem-co-founders-Magnus-Olsson-Mudassir-Sheikha-and-Abdulla-Elyas.jpg?w=680"></p><p>There is some overlap in regional market operation currently. So it remains to be seen whether both brands will continue to operate in cities such as Cairo or Casablanca indefinitely — or whether Careem might ultimately prevail as the selected brand for Middle Eastern and select Asian markets.</p><p>On this an Uber spokeswoman told us: “Nothing changes until the transaction is closed in Q1 2020 per regulatory approval.

Better yet, the company’s debut physical titanium credit card  won’t even have a credit card number.\n\nNow if someone wants to commit fraud, they need to steal your phone and your face or fingerprint.\n\nLike other sensitive data — such as health, financial and biometric data — any banking and credit card data is stored on the device’s security chip, known as the secure enclave.\n\nApple Card will be available in the U.S. later this summer.',

From working 3 jobs in high school, to selling on Etsy&nbsp;today, I\'ve been able to build up secondary income streams in a variety of ways. When I tell people about my pursuits in <a href=\\"https://www.inc.com/arianna-odell/heres-how-you-can-start-a-side-business-in-10-minutes-per-day.html\\">passive income and side hustling</a>, I\'m met with a barrage of questions. Here are the most common that can help you overcome your hesitations and get started today:&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>1.&nbsp;How can I get started?</h2>\\r\\n<p>I\'ve always loved making gifts for friends and always thought there was need in the market for funny quirky gifts when I was shopping. I began creating my own products for fun and to my surprise others wanted them too.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>There are so many ways you can get started with a side hustle. Whether you pick up a second job for the weekends, or sell a product to consumers, there are many ways to generate additional income streams.</p>\\r\\n<p>To get started, think about a skill that you have that provides value to others and see how you can turn it into a business. Are you an amazing pie maker? Sell pies to those in your community. Do you know how to code? On the weekends, use your skills to build websites for clients. The first step in side hustling is to take a step back to see what you\'re good at. Then you can figure out a way to monetize it.</p>\\r\\n<h2>2. What about taxes and licenses?&nbsp;</h2>\\r\\n<p>Taxes can be intimidating and prevent new entrepreneurs&nbsp;from ever getting started with their side hustle. Though I don\'t have a background in business logistics, I learned everything I needed to know about taxes and licensing from Google searches and talking to seasoned enraptures.</p>\\r\\n<p>It might feel scary to wade into uncharted regulatory&nbsp;waters,&nbsp;you can find many digestible articles online that can help you break down the legalities of running a business. And you\'d be surprised how easy it is to get started. In most states, you can form a sole proprietorship&nbsp;for around $50 or register an LLC for around $200.</p>\\r\\n<p>While I did all of this myself, if you\'re still feeling hesitant about starting a business, a tax professional and consultant can often get you on the right track when you\'re just starting off.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>3. What are some easy side hustles to start?&nbsp;</h2>\\r\\n<p>Some common side hustles that are easy to start including, writing, website creation, social media management, teaching a language, and selling products online. For my side hustle, I use print-on demand technology to sell a wide range of products from yoga mats to t-shirts.</p>\\r\\n<p>Think about a skill that would benefit others or an activity you love doing. Then you can work backwards to think about what kinds of people would pay for the service and how it could provide value to others. From writing eBooks, to showing others how to organize, there are many ways you can turn your expertise into education that people would gladly pay for.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>4. How can I find the time?</h2>\\r\\n<p>You don\'t need an entire day of the week to get started with side hustling. In fact, you can get started in as little as 10 minutes a day.

From working 3 jobs in high school, to selling on Etsy&amp;nbsp;today, I&apos;ve been able to build up secondary income streams in a variety of ways. When I tell people about my pursuits in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/arianna-odell/heres-how-you-can-start-a-side-business-in-10-minutes-per-day.html&quot;&gt;passive income and side hustling&lt;/a&gt;, I&apos;m met with a barrage of questions. Here are the most common that can help you overcome your hesitations and get started today:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;h2&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;How can I get started?&lt;/h2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve always loved making gifts for friends and always thought there was need in the market for funny quirky gifts when I was shopping. I began creating my own products for fun and to my surprise others wanted them too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;There are so many ways you can get started with a side hustle. Whether you pick up a second job for the weekends, or sell a product to consumers, there are many ways to generate additional income streams.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;To get started, think about a skill that you have that provides value to others and see how you can turn it into a business. Are you an amazing pie maker? Sell pies to those in your community. Do you know how to code? On the weekends, use your skills to build websites for clients. The first step in side hustling is to take a step back to see what you&apos;re good at. Then you can figure out a way to monetize it.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;h2&gt;2. What about taxes and licenses?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;Taxes can be intimidating and prevent new entrepreneurs&amp;nbsp;from ever getting started with their side hustle. Though I don&apos;t have a background in business logistics, I learned everything I needed to know about taxes and licensing from Google searches and talking to seasoned enraptures.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;It might feel scary to wade into uncharted regulatory&amp;nbsp;waters,&amp;nbsp;you can find many digestible articles online that can help you break down the legalities of running a business. And you&apos;d be surprised how easy it is to get started. In most states, you can form a sole proprietorship&amp;nbsp;for around $50 or register an LLC for around $200.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;While I did all of this myself, if you&apos;re still feeling hesitant about starting a business, a tax professional and consultant can often get you on the right track when you&apos;re just starting off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;h2&gt;3. What are some easy side hustles to start?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;Some common side hustles that are easy to start including, writing, website creation, social media management, teaching a language, and selling products online. For my side hustle, I use print-on demand technology to sell a wide range of products from yoga mats to t-shirts.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;Think about a skill that would benefit others or an activity you love doing. Then you can work backwards to think about what kinds of people would pay for the service and how it could provide value to others. From writing eBooks, to showing others how to organize, there are many ways you can turn your expertise into education that people would gladly pay for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;h2&gt;4. How can I find the time?&lt;/h2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t need an entire day of the week to get started with side hustling. In fact, you can get started in as little as 10 minutes a day. Simply starting small and building over time can help you create lucrative future income streams.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;For over two years, I worked on my store for 10-15 minutes a day when I was done with my client work. Now it&apos;s providing me a steady stream of income.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;If you have time to watch Netflix, you have time to start a business. Get started today and reap the benefits tomorrow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","adinfo":{"c_type":"article","showlogo":true,"cms":"inc226487","video":"no","aut":["arianna-odell"],"channelArray":{"topid":"40","topfilelocation":"strategy","primary":["grow","innovate","startup"],"primaryFilelocation":["grow","innovate","startup"],"primaryname":["Grow","Innovate","Startup"],"sub":["strategy","creativity","homebased"],"subFilelocation":["strategy","creativity","home-based-business"],"subname":["Strategy","Creativity","Home-Based Business"]},"adzone":"/4160/mv.inc/grow/strategy/strategy"},"seriesname":null,"editorname":null,"commentcount":null,"inc5000companies":[],"companies":[],"buyerzonewidgets":[],"photoEssaySlideModels":null,"custom_article_footer":null,"ser_footer_blurb":null,"dayssincepubdate":20,"trackingpixel":"","promotions":null,"inline_script_tags":[],"loadedFully":true,"promoimage":"https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_651138524_384024.jpg","largepromoimage":"https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1940x900/getty_651138524_384024.jpg","pubdate":"2019-02-22T09:51:44.000Z","author":"Arianna O\'Dell","authortwitter":"@arianna","articlesection":"Grow"},"server698193":{"id":227288,"inc_homepage_headline":"Is Your Perfectionism Killing Your Success?

Backed by roughly $40 million in venture capital, Omni proclaims on its website that they “<a href="https://www.beomni.com/about">believe in experiences over things</a>, access over ownership, and living lighter rather than being weighed down by our possessions.”</p><p>If you’re in the Bay Area, you can currently <a href="https://app.beomni.com/items/1afa5a51-fc24-42d8-b95e-d363f0e1e4d5">rent a copy</a> of<em> The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</em> by Marie Kondo from “Lan” for the low price of $1 per day; “charles” is <a href="https://app.beomni.com/items/fac61464-0dd5-4e32-9756-6933d10daa8f">renting a small framed lithograph</a> for $10 a day; and “Tom” is <a href="https://app.beomni.com/items/cc7f5b82-baaf-4ba1-9d15-4f6a62c0d893">renting a copy of the film</a> <em>Friends With Benefits</em> (68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) on Blu-ray for just $2 a day. Those prices don’t include delivery and return fees for the Omni trucks traversing the city, which <a href="https://www.beomni.com/pricing">start at $1.99</a> each way.</p><p>In 2016, Omni’s CEO and co-founder Tom McLeod <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/2016/08/10/san-francisco-startup-omni-wants-make-everything-part-sharing-economy/">said that</a> “lending enables Omni members to put their ‘dormant’ belongings to good use in their community.” That same year, <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/06/omni-envisions-true-sharing-economy/">Fortune said</a> Omni “could create a true ‘sharing economy.’” For a while, the tenets of the sharing economy were front and center in Omni’s model: It promised to activate underutilitized assets in order to sustain a healthier world and build community trust. In 2017, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/24/omni-rental/">McLeod said</a>, “We want to change behavior around ownership on the planet.”</p><p>Just three years later, those promises seem second to the pursuit of profit. In 2019, the Omni pitch can be summed up by the ads emblazoned on its delivery trucks: “Rent things from your neighbors, earn money when they rent from you!”</p><p>For years, the sharing economy was pitched as an altruistic form of capitalism — an answer to consumption run amok. Why own your own car or power tools or copies of <em>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</em> if each sat idle for most of its life? The sharing economy would let strangers around the world maximize the utility of every possession to the benefit of all.</p><blockquote>Sharing was supposed to transform our world for the better.</blockquote><p>In a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption/transcript">2010 TED Talk</a>, sharing economy champion and author Rachel Botsman argued that the tech-enabled <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption?language=en">sharing economy could</a> “mimic the ties that used to happen face to face but on a scale and in a way that has never been possible before.” Botsman quoted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/magazine/08Zipcar-t.html">a<em> New York</em> <em>Times</em> piece</a> in saying, “Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the eight track, what solar power is to the coal mine.” In 2013, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/opinion/sunday/friedman-welcome-to-the-sharing-economy.html">Thomas Friedman proclaimed</a> that Airbnb’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/04/trust-in-the-share-economy/">true innovation wasn’t</a> its platform or its distributed business model: “It’s ‘trust.’” At a 2014 conference, Uber investor Shervin Pishevar said sharing was going to bring us back to a mythical bygone era of low-impact, communal village living.</p><p>More than 10 years since the dawn of the sharing economy, these promises sound painfully out of date. Why rent a DVD from your neighbor, or own a DVD at all, when you can stream your movies online? Why use Airbnb for a single room in your home when you can sublease an entire apartment and run a lucrative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/nyregion/airbnb-illegal-brokers-real-estate.html">off-the-books hotel operation</a>? Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb — startups that banked on the promises of the sharing economy — are now worth tens of billions, with plans go public. (Lyft filed for an IPO on March 1.) These companies and the pundits who hyped them have all but abandoned the sharing argument that gave this industry life and allowed it to skirt government regulations for years. Sharing was supposed to transform our world for the better. Instead, the only thing we’re sharing is the mess it left behind.</p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9f3cshm-M1al7vIiMsnlZA.png"></span><span>T</span></span>he first glimpses of the sharing economy emerged years before the term came into popular use. In 1995, Craigslist mainstreamed the direct donation, renting, and sale of everything from pets and furniture to apartments and homes. Starting in 2000, Zipcar let members rent cars for everyday errands and short trips with the express goal of taking more cars off the road. And CouchSurfing, launched as a nonprofit in 2004, suddenly turned every living room into a hostel. This first wave of sharing was eclectic and sometimes even profitable, but before the mass adoption of the smartphone, it failed to capture the public’s imagination.</p><p>Though its origin is vague, many credit the introduction of the term “sharing economy” into the broader tech lexicon to Lawrence Lessig, who wrote about sharing in his 2008 book <em>Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy</em>. The Great Recession was just setting in, and the sharing economy was touted as a new DIY social safety net/business model hybrid. The contours of the term were never particularly clear. It was used loosely to describe peer-to-peer projects and tech-enabled rental markets but also included old barter, co-op, and casual carpooling models. The sharing economy was a broad, eclectic movement with ambitious if utopian goals. The <a href="https://www.shareable.net/about">online magazine Shareable</a> launched in 2009 to document this “movement of movements.”</p><blockquote>Sharing would be the instrument by which we’d be able to know one another again, a counterbalance to the alienation of a burgeoning tech dystopia.</blockquote><p>Sharing would help reduce overconsumption and our impact on the environment. Venture capitalist and tech trend spotter <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/12/mary-meeker-possessions/">Mary Meeker said</a> Americans were moving from an “asset-heavy lifestyle to an asset-light existence” with the sharing economy leading the charge. Environment and politics researcher <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e91/16758a648724c637597825af1065a8c50dbe.pdf">Harald Heinrichs suggested</a> the sharing economy was a “potential new pathway to sustainability.” Greenpeace’s <a href="https://storyofstuff.org/blog/its-time-to-replace-more-with-better-2/">Annie Leonard</a> framed sharing in <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/the-human-cost-of-stuff/annie-leonard-more-than-a-mindful-consumer">opposition to consuming</a>: The sharing economy, she wrote, would “conserve resources, give people access to stuff they otherwise couldn’t afford, and build community.”</p><p>Sharing also promised social benefits. It would be the instrument by which we’d be able to know one another again, a counterbalance to the alienation of a burgeoning tech dystopia. <a href="https://www.harrywalker.com/speakers/april-rinne">Sharing economy expert</a> April Rinne said sharing would recreate the social fabric of tight-knit communities. “Engaging in collaborative consumption — and getting used to it — lowers the trust barrier over time,” <a href="http://www.shareable.net/blog/lessons-from-microfinance-for-the-sharing-economy">she wrote</a> at Shareable. New <a href="https://twitter.com/trustcloud">startups like TrustCloud</a> would gather all of our disparate platform ratings and social trails from across the web and compile them into a new kind of social credit score that would enable <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trustcloud">trust and accountability</a> in the sharing economy.</p><p>The new opportunities to earn money by freelancing part-time as a handyman, innkeeper, or taxi driver would bridge the wealth gap and ameliorate global inequality. In 2013, CNN contributor <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/01/08/opinion/jones-share-economy/index.html">Van Jones said</a> that sharing could lead us to “a more sustainable, prosperous future.”</p><p>Adam Werbach was president of the Sierra Club and a corporate sustainability consultant before he co-founded the used goods sharing marketplace Yerdle in 2012. A sort of proto-Omni, Yerdle’s original tagline was, “Stop buying. Start sharing.” The site incentivized renters to rent their own things by rewarding them with credits and keeping used goods recycling in the Yerdle community.</p><p>“There was a mix of venture-backed companies, social-benefit companies, and nonprofits all in the space, all fighting for it. And all of the companies were small, and all the founders hung out — it was a community,” Werbach says of those heady early times. “I had hoped this would be the taming of capitalism.”</p><p>Janelle Orsi, attorney, co-founder, and executive director of the Sustainable Economies Law Center, used to call herself a sharing lawyer, which, she says now, “a lot of people thought was a joke.” Orsi helped set up small workers cooperatives and worked on cottage food legislation to make it possible for people in California to sell food they cooked at home on a small scale both on and off digital platforms.</p><p>For Orsi, the sharing pitch had some value in selling an idea that was uncomfortable at the time. “It took a certain kind of community-oriented person willing to take a risk and book an Airbnb or get in an Uber early on,” says Orsi. For her, and likely for many of the early sharing adopters, truly cleaner, lighter living through platform technology was seductive and incredibly promising. But that innocence was short-lived.</p><p>“I had a very grassroots community-based vision of it,” she says. “And then all of a sudden, here comes the big tech companies. It was totally hijacked.”</p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K1m8OQ0CwvfyECYZb4z6hw.png"></span><span>P</span></span>erhaps no company is as emblematic of the sharing economy sector and its rapid evolution as Lyft. Zimride, Lyft’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3555783&amp;page=1">original parent company</a>, was a service that focused on college campuses and long-distance rides in areas with few other transit options. Co-founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/6000-words-about-a-pink-mustache/">Logan Green told reporters</a> he was inspired by the slow grind of Los Angeles traffic, thick with single-occupant cars. If he could find a way to entice more people to carpool, Green reasoned, there would be less traffic on the road.</p><p>In 2012, Zimride launched Lyft to service shorter rides in cities. Lyft advertised “<a href="http://get.lyft.com/download/x.html">friendly rides</a>,” encouraging passengers to sit up front alongside the driver and pay a suggested donation if they felt like it. The <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/How-ride-share-services-skirt-taxi-rules-3835566.php">company argued</a> that because the platform only acted to connect riders and drivers, with payment optional, it couldn’t be regulated as a taxi service provider. But just a year after it was spun out, Lyft instituted set ride fares and had already raised $83 million in financing. It was a sharing economy success story: In 2015, Lyft was recognized by the <a href="https://thecirculars.org/our-finalists/filter/eyJyZXN1bHRfcGFnZSI6Im91ci1maW5hbGlzdHNcL2ZpbHRlciIsInNlYXJjaDpjc195ZWFyIjoiMjAxNSJ9">Circulars economy awards</a> at Davos for “helping to decongest roads.”</p><blockquote>Seemingly everything was a part of this new economy.</blockquote><p>Over the first half of the 2010s<strong>, </strong>the so-called sharing economy evolved into a powerful new multibillion-dollar economic model.

The organization said the bulk of its funding <a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/08/02/who_owns_the_sharing_economy/">came from</a> “mission-aligned independent donors” and foundations, but it also had <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3022974/is-peers-the-sharing-economys-future-or-just-a-great-silicon-valley-pr-stunt">investment from Airbnb</a>.</p><p>By 2016, Peers had pivoted to <a href="https://wtfeconomy.com/friends-with-portable-benefits-shaping-a-new-system-with-lessons-from-existing-models-d5d36f531a8d">portable benefits</a> — an infrastructure to sustain gig workers as they labored without an employment safety net.

Peers co-founder <a href="https://medium.com/@nataliefoster">Natalie Foster</a> went on to <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/who-we-are/">co-found the Economic Security Project</a>, which lobbies for a new solution to help struggling gig workers and job-havers alike: universal basic income.</p><blockquote>It’s now about “platforms,” “on-demand services,” or, most recently, “the gig economy.”</blockquote><p>In 2018, April Rinne, who previously pushed the sharing economy’s promise of a “tighter social fabric,” <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/the-dark-side-of-the-sharing-economy/">acknowledged “the dark side”</a> of the sharing economy but wrote that “the challenges faced by the sharing economy today are largely a result of its success.” Rachel Botsman, who argued that sharing would allow us to trust one another again, now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/dawn-of-the-techlash">writes about how technology</a> and the concentration of power on large centralized platforms has led to<strong> </strong>“an erosion of trust.”</p><p>The demand for Botsman’s mythical community-shared power drill never seemed to materialize. Neighborly goods-sharing platforms Crowd Rent, ThingLoop, and SnapGoods are all many years dead, and meal-sharing Josephine ended long ago. CouchSurfing has gone for-profit, with venture capital investment.</p><p>It turns out sharing “is not really a mass-market idea, which is sort of depressing,” says Werbach, who’s pivoted Yerdle into a logistics firm for large brands interested in re-selling their used goods. “Kindergarten teachers are interested in that, but consumers are really interested in what’s in it for them.”</p></div></div><div><div><p><span><span><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9UGbUtX6-jzLNpmxJO5Oqg.png"></span><span>S</span></span>ome of the early, true sharing believers have decamped for the growing platform cooperative movement. “Now there’s a <a href="https://platform.coop/">whole consortium</a> of platform cooperatives,” says Orsi of the Sustainable Economies Law Center.</p><p>And these companies don’t bank on sharing. Organizations like <a href="https://loconomics.com/">Loconomics</a>, <a href="https://fairbnb.coop/">Fairbnb</a>, and <a href="https://www.stocksy.com/">Stocksy</a> see their efforts at cooperative consumption and production less as altruism and more as collectively owning the means of production.</p><p>Sharing tapped into economic anxiety, isolation, and frustration with contemporary U.S. middle-class life in a unique and ultimately profitable way. It was another iteration of Silicon Valley’s excruciating trope of changing the world by way of disruption, wrapped in a soft packaging of eco-friendly, feel-good liberalism. We were encouraged to give companies like Lyft and Airbnb a chance, to <a href="https://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-care-and-feeding-of-tech-boom">nurture them</a> and help them along for the greater good. If we didn’t believe in sharing, we weren’t just cynics but enemies of progress.</p><p>Many of the corporations and the pundits who sold us on the promises of sharing stopped using the term because consumers no longer found it believable or attractive. But it was consumers who really did sharing in. A true sharing economy is full of friction and discomfort, and the margins — if there are any to speak of — are paper thin. Real sharing is time-consuming and not particularly profitable for anyone.</p><blockquote>“Now it’s just a transaction. It doesn’t need to be dressed up in any language about changing the world or whatever.”</blockquote><p>In order to make money, especially the kind of money that tech investors expect, venture-backed companies couldn’t just activate underutilized resources — they had to make more. For-profit businesses demand growth, and platforms demand scale. More than a decade into the sharing experiment, we’ve been able to fully assess the costs. Capitalism wasn’t tamed, as Werbach had hoped — it was stoked.</p><p>“Now it’s just a transaction,” Werbach says. “It doesn’t need to be dressed up in any language about changing the world or whatever.”</p><p>And though sharing is largely dead, other tech-driven models have taken its place: VC-backed enterprises that still skate on the promise of <a href="https://psmag.com/environment/basically-its-an-app-that-keeps-poor-people-poor-the-vcs-will-love-it">solving inequality</a>, <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/fintech_for_the_financially_excluded">promoting justice</a>, <a href="https://www.affirm.com/business/company/">fixing broken systems</a>, and doing what regulators and big, old businesses have failed to do for decades.</p><p>These days, it’s not a shared drill that’s redefining trust and supplanting institutional intermediaries; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-blockchain-is-redefining-trust/">it’s the blockchain</a>. Botsman now says that the blockchain is the next step in shifting trust from institutions to strangers. “Even though most people barely know what the blockchain is, a decade or so from now, it will be like the internet,” she writes. “We’ll wonder how society ever functioned without it.”</p><p>The ambitious promises all sound very familiar.</p></div></div></div></div>',
      ssml: '<speak><p>The Sharing Economy Was Always a Scam.</p><break time="500ms" /><p>‘Sharing’ was supposed to save us. Instead, it became a Trojan horse for a precarious economic future.<break time="1s" />.</p><p>Founded in 2014, Omni is a startup that offers users the ability to store and rent their lesser-used stuff in the San Francisco Bay Area and Portland. Backed by roughly $40 million in venture capital, Omni proclaims on its website that they “believe in experiences over things, access over ownership, and living lighter rather than being weighed down by our possessions.”</p><p>If you’re in the Bay Area, you can currently rent a copy of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo from “Lan” for the low price of $1 per day; “charles” is renting a small framed lithograph for $10 a day; and “Tom” is renting a copy of the film Friends With Benefits (68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) on Blu-ray for just $2 a day. Those prices don’t include delivery and return fees for the Omni trucks traversing the city, which start at $1.99 each way.</p><p>In 2016, Omni’s CEO and co-founder Tom McLeod said that “lending enables Omni members to put their ‘dormant’ belongings to good use in their community.” That same year, Fortune said Omni “could create a true ‘sharing economy.’” For a while, the tenets of the sharing economy were front and center in Omni’s model: It promised to activate underutilitized assets in order to sustain a healthier world and build community trust. In 2017, McLeod said, “We want to change behavior around ownership on the planet.”</p><p>Just three years later, those promises seem second to the pursuit of profit. In 2019, the Omni pitch can be summed up by the ads emblazoned on its delivery trucks: “Rent things from your neighbors, earn money when they rent from you!”</p><p>For years, the sharing economy was pitched as an altruistic form of capitalism — an answer to consumption run amok. Why own your own car or power tools or copies of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up if each sat idle for most of its life? The sharing economy would let strangers around the world maximize the utility of every possession to the benefit of all.</p><p>&gt; Sharing was supposed to transform our world for the better.</p><p>In a 2010 TED Talk, sharing economy champion and author Rachel Botsman argued that the tech-enabled sharing economy could “mimic the ties that used to happen face to face but on a scale and in a way that has never been possible before.” Botsman quoted a New York Times piece in saying, “Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the eight track, what solar power is to the coal mine.” In 2013, Thomas Friedman proclaimed that Airbnb’s true innovation wasn’t its platform or its distributed business model: “It’s ‘trust.’” At a 2014 conference, Uber investor Shervin Pishevar said sharing was going to bring us back to a mythical bygone era of low-impact, communal village living.</p><p>More than 10 years since the dawn of the sharing economy, these promises sound painfully out of date. Why rent a DVD from your neighbor, or own a DVD at all, when you can stream your movies online? Why use Airbnb for a single room in your home when you can sublease an entire apartment and run a lucrative off-the-books hotel operation? Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb — startups that banked on the promises of the sharing economy — are now worth tens of billions, with plans go public. (Lyft filed for an IPO on March 1.) These companies and the pundits who hyped them have all but abandoned the sharing argument that gave this industry life and allowed it to skirt government regulations for years. Sharing was supposed to transform our world for the better. Instead, the only thing we’re sharing is the mess it left behind.</p><p>The first glimpses of the sharing economy emerged years before the term came into popular use. In 1995, Craigslist mainstreamed the direct donation, renting, and sale of everything from pets and furniture to apartments and homes. Starting in 2000, Zipcar let members rent cars for everyday errands and short trips with the express goal of taking more cars off the road. And CouchSurfing, launched as a nonprofit in 2004, suddenly turned every living room into a hostel. This first wave of sharing was eclectic and sometimes even profitable, but before the mass adoption of the smartphone, it failed to capture the public’s imagination.</p><p>Though its origin is vague, many credit the introduction of the term “sharing economy” into the broader tech lexicon to Lawrence Lessig, who wrote about sharing in his 2008 book Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy. The Great Recession was just setting in, and the sharing economy was touted as a new DIY social safety net/business model hybrid. The contours of the term were never particularly clear. It was used loosely to describe peer-to-peer projects and tech-enabled rental markets but also included old barter, co-op, and casual carpooling models. The sharing economy was a broad, eclectic movement with ambitious if utopian goals. The online magazine Shareable launched in 2009 to document this “movement of movements.”</p><p>&gt; Sharing would be the instrument by which we’d be able to know one another again, a counterbalance to the alienation of a burgeoning tech dystopia.</p><p>Sharing would help reduce overconsumption and our impact on the environment. Venture capitalist and tech trend spotter Mary Meeker said Americans were moving from an “asset-heavy lifestyle to an asset-light existence” with the sharing economy leading the charge. Environment and politics researcher Harald Heinrichs suggested the sharing economy was a “potential new pathway to sustainability.” Greenpeace’s Annie Leonard framed sharing in opposition to consuming: The sharing economy, she wrote, would “conserve resources, give people access to stuff they otherwise couldn’t afford, and build community.”</p><p>Sharing also promised social benefits. It would be the instrument by which we’d be able to know one another again, a counterbalance to the alienation of a burgeoning tech dystopia. Sharing economy expert April Rinne said sharing would recreate the social fabric of tight-knit communities. “Engaging in collaborative consumption — and getting used to it — lowers the trust barrier over time,” she wrote at Shareable. New startups like TrustCloud would gather all of our disparate platform ratings and social trails from across the web and compile them into a new kind of social credit score that would enable trust and accountability in the sharing economy.</p><p>The new opportunities to earn money by freelancing part-time as a handyman, innkeeper, or taxi driver would bridge the wealth gap and ameliorate global inequality. In 2013, CNN contributor Van Jones said that sharing could lead us to “a more sustainable, prosperous future.”</p><p>Adam Werbach was president of the Sierra Club and a corporate sustainability consultant before he co-founded the used goods sharing marketplace Yerdle in 2012. A sort of proto-Omni, Yerdle’s original tagline was, “Stop buying. Start sharing.” The site incentivized renters to rent their own things by rewarding them with credits and keeping used goods recycling in the Yerdle community.</p><p>“There was a mix of venture-backed companies, social-benefit companies, and nonprofits all in the space, all fighting for it. And all of the companies were small, and all the founders hung out — it was a community,” Werbach says of those heady early times. “I had hoped this would be the taming of capitalism.”</p><p>Janelle Orsi, attorney, co-founder, and executive director of the Sustainable Economies Law Center, used to call herself a sharing lawyer, which, she says now, “a lot of people thought was a joke.” Orsi helped set up small workers cooperatives and worked on cottage food legislation to make it possible for people in California to sell food they cooked at home on a small scale both on and off digital platforms.</p><p>For Orsi, the sharing pitch had some value in selling an idea that was uncomfortable at the time. “It took a certain kind of community-oriented person willing to take a risk and book an Airbnb or get in an Uber early on,” says Orsi. For her, and likely for many of the early sharing adopters, truly cleaner, lighter living through platform technology was seductive and incredibly promising. But that innocence was short-lived.</p><p>“I had a very grassroots community-based vision of it,” she says. “And then all of a sudden, here comes the big tech companies. It was totally hijacked.”</p><p>Perhaps no company is as emblematic of the sharing economy sector and its rapid evolution as Lyft. Zimride, Lyft’s original parent company, was a service that focused on college campuses and long-distance rides in areas with few other transit options. Co-founder Logan Green told reporters he was inspired by the slow grind of Los Angeles traffic, thick with single-occupant cars. If he could find a way to entice more people to carpool, Green reasoned, there would be less traffic on the road.</p><p>In 2012, Zimride launched Lyft to service shorter rides in cities. Lyft advertised “friendly rides,” encouraging passengers to sit up front alongside the driver and pay a suggested donation if they felt like it. The company argued that because the platform only acted to connect riders and drivers, with payment optional, it couldn’t be regulated as a taxi service provider. But just a year after it was spun out, Lyft instituted set ride fares and had already raised $83 million in financing. It was a sharing economy success story: In 2015, Lyft was recognized by the Circulars economy awards at Davos for “helping to decongest roads.”</p><p>&gt; Seemingly everything was a part of this new economy.</p><p>Over the first half of the 2010s, the so-called sharing economy evolved into a powerful new multibillion-dollar economic model. At about the same time, the definition of “sharing” began to shift. Sharing still referred to the peer-to-peer model of leveraging underutilized assets — sharing our goods with each other — but it was also increasingly applied to more traditional centralized rental models.</p><p>Seemingly everything was a part of this new economy: bike-sharing sponsored by multinational banks, apps that allowed people to rent parking spaces on public streets, and platforms that allowed for the peer-to-peer sale of used clothes. Sharing was the donor-funded nonprofit Wikipedia, and it was the massive unicorn WeWork. When the Avis Budget Group bought short-term car-rental service ZipCar in 2013, investor Steve Case said it was an indicator of the sharing economy’s growing potential. “Sharing is not a passing fad,” he wrote in the Washington Post. “Fasten your seatbelts: It’s just the beginning.”</p><p>Even though the term “sharing” was quickly being drained of any meaning, industry insiders still touted its social benefits.

      text: '‘SHARING’ WAS SUPPOSED TO SAVE US. INSTEAD, IT BECAME A TROJAN HORSE FOR A PRECARIOUS ECONOMIC FUTURE.\n \n\nFounded in 2014, Omni is a startup that offers users the ability to store and rent their lesser-used stuff in the San Francisco Bay Area and Portland. Backed by roughly $40 million in venture capital, Omni proclaims on its website that they “believe in experiences over things , access over ownership, and living lighter rather than being weighed down by our possessions.”\n\nIf you’re in the Bay Area, you can currently rent a copy  of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo from “Lan” for the low price of $1 per day; “charles” is renting a small framed lithograph  for $10 a day; and “Tom” is renting a copy of the film  Friends With Benefits (68 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) on Blu-ray for just $2 a day. Those prices don’t include delivery and return fees for the Omni trucks traversing the city, which start at $1.99  each way.\n\nIn 2016, Omni’s CEO and co-founder Tom McLeod said that  “lending enables Omni members to put their ‘dormant’ belongings to good use in their community.” That same year, Fortune said  Omni “could create a true ‘sharing economy.’” For a while, the tenets of the sharing economy were front and center in Omni’s model: It promised to activate underutilitized assets in order to sustain a healthier world and build community trust. In 2017, McLeod said , “We want to change behavior around ownership on the planet.”\n\nJust three years later, those promises seem second to the pursuit of profit. In 2019, the Omni pitch can be summed up by the ads emblazoned on its delivery trucks: “Rent things from your neighbors, earn money when they rent from you!”\n\nFor years, the sharing economy was pitched as an altruistic form of capitalism — an answer to consumption run amok. Why own your own car or power tools or copies of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up if each sat idle for most of its life? The sharing economy would let strangers around the world maximize the utility of every possession to the benefit of all.\n\n&gt; Sharing was supposed to transform our world for the better.\nIn a 2010 TED Talk , sharing economy champion and author Rachel Botsman argued that the tech-enabled sharing economy could  “mimic the ties that used to happen face to face but on a scale and in a way that has never been possible before.” Botsman quoted a New York Times piece  in saying, “Sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the eight track, what solar power is to the coal mine.” In 2013, Thomas Friedman proclaimed  that Airbnb’s true innovation wasn’t  its platform or its distributed business model: “It’s ‘trust.’” At a 2014 conference, Uber investor Shervin Pishevar said sharing was going to bring us back to a mythical bygone era of low-impact, communal village living.\n\nMore than 10 years since the dawn of the sharing economy, these promises sound painfully out of date. Why rent a DVD from your neighbor, or own a DVD at all, when you can stream your movies online? Why use Airbnb for a single room in your home when you can sublease an entire apartment and run a lucrative off-the-books hotel operation ? Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb — startups that banked on the promises of the sharing economy — are now worth tens of billions, with plans go public. (Lyft filed for an IPO on March 1.) These companies and the pundits who hyped them have all but abandoned the sharing argument that gave this industry life and allowed it to skirt government regulations for years. Sharing was supposed to transform our world for the better. Instead, the only thing we’re sharing is the mess it left behind.\n\nThe first glimpses of the sharing economy emerged years before the term came into popular use. In 1995, Craigslist mainstreamed the direct donation, renting, and sale of everything from pets and furniture to apartments and homes. Starting in 2000, Zipcar let members rent cars for everyday errands and short trips with the express goal of taking more cars off the road. And CouchSurfing, launched as a nonprofit in 2004, suddenly turned every living room into a hostel. This first wave of sharing was eclectic and sometimes even profitable, but before the mass adoption of the smartphone, it failed to capture the public’s imagination.\n\nThough its origin is vague, many credit the introduction of the term “sharing economy” into the broader tech lexicon to Lawrence Lessig, who wrote about sharing in his 2008 book Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy. The Great Recession was just setting in, and the sharing economy was touted as a new DIY social safety net/business model hybrid. The contours of the term were never particularly clear. It was used loosely to describe peer-to-peer projects and tech-enabled rental markets but also included old barter, co-op, and casual carpooling models. The sharing economy was a broad, eclectic movement with ambitious if utopian goals. The online magazine Shareable  launched in 2009 to document this “movement of movements.”\n\n&gt; Sharing would be the instrument by which we’d be able to know one another again, a counterbalance to the alienation of a burgeoning tech dystopia.\nSharing would help reduce overconsumption and our impact on the environment. Venture capitalist and tech trend spotter Mary Meeker said  Americans were moving from an “asset-heavy lifestyle to an asset-light existence” with the sharing economy leading the charge. Environment and politics researcher Harald Heinrichs suggested  the sharing economy was a “potential new pathway to sustainability.” Greenpeace’s Annie Leonard  framed sharing in opposition to consuming : The sharing economy, she wrote, would “conserve resources, give people access to stuff they otherwise couldn’t afford, and build community.”\n\nSharing also promised social benefits. It would be the instrument by which we’d be able to know one another again, a counterbalance to the alienation of a burgeoning tech dystopia. Sharing economy expert  April Rinne said sharing would recreate the social fabric of tight-knit communities. “Engaging in collaborative consumption — and getting used to it — lowers the trust barrier over time,” she wrote  at Shareable. New startups like TrustCloud  would gather all of our disparate platform ratings and social trails from across the web and compile them into a new kind of social credit score that would enable trust and accountability  in the sharing economy.\n\nThe new opportunities to earn money by freelancing part-time as a handyman, innkeeper, or taxi driver would bridge the wealth gap and ameliorate global inequality. In 2013, CNN contributor Van Jones said  that sharing could lead us to “a more sustainable, prosperous future.”\n\nAdam Werbach was president of the Sierra Club and a corporate sustainability consultant before he co-founded the used goods sharing marketplace Yerdle in 2012. A sort of proto-Omni, Yerdle’s original tagline was, “Stop buying. Start sharing.” The site incentivized renters to rent their own things by rewarding them with credits and keeping used goods recycling in the Yerdle community.\n\n“There was a mix of venture-backed companies, social-benefit companies, and nonprofits all in the space, all fighting for it. And all of the companies were small, and all the founders hung out — it was a community,” Werbach says of those heady early times. “I had hoped this would be the taming of capitalism.”\n\nJanelle Orsi, attorney, co-founder, and executive director of the Sustainable Economies Law Center, used to call herself a sharing lawyer, which, she says now, “a lot of people thought was a joke.” Orsi helped set up small workers cooperatives and worked on cottage food legislation to make it possible for people in California to sell food they cooked at home on a small scale both on and off digital platforms.\n\nFor Orsi, the sharing pitch had some value in selling an idea that was uncomfortable at the time. “It took a certain kind of community-oriented person willing to take a risk and book an Airbnb or get in an Uber early on,” says Orsi. For her, and likely for many of the early sharing adopters, truly cleaner, lighter living through platform technology was seductive and incredibly promising. But that innocence was short-lived.\n\n“I had a very grassroots community-based vision of it,” she says. “And then all of a sudden, here comes the big tech companies. It was totally hijacked.”\n\nPerhaps no company is as emblematic of the sharing economy sector and its rapid evolution as Lyft. Zimride, Lyft’s original parent company , was a service that focused on college campuses and long-distance rides in areas with few other transit options. Co-founder Logan Green told reporters  he was inspired by the slow grind of Los Angeles traffic, thick with single-occupant cars. If he could find a way to entice more people to carpool, Green reasoned, there would be less traffic on the road.\n\nIn 2012, Zimride launched Lyft to service shorter rides in cities. Lyft advertised “friendly rides ,” encouraging passengers to sit up front alongside the driver and pay a suggested donation if they felt like it. The company argued  that because the platform only acted to connect riders and drivers, with payment optional, it couldn’t be regulated as a taxi service provider. But just a year after it was spun out, Lyft instituted set ride fares and had already raised $83 million in financing. It was a sharing economy success story: In 2015, Lyft was recognized by the Circulars economy awards  at Davos for “helping to decongest roads.”\n\n&gt; Seemingly everything was a part of this new economy.\nOver the first half of the 2010s, the so-called sharing economy evolved into a powerful new multibillion-dollar economic model. At about the same time, the definition of “sharing” began to shift. Sharing still referred to the peer-to-peer model of leveraging underutilized assets — sharing our goods with each other — but it was also increasingly applied to more traditional centralized rental models.\n\nSeemingly everything was a part of this new economy: bike-sharing sponsored by multinational banks, apps that allowed people to rent parking spaces on public streets, and platforms that allowed for the peer-to-peer sale of used clothes. Sharing was the donor-funded nonprofit Wikipedia, and it was the massive unicorn WeWork . When the Avis Budget Group bought short-term car-rental service ZipCar in 2013, investor Steve Case said  it was an indicator of the sharing economy’s growing potential. “Sharing is not a passing fad,” he wrote in the Washington Post. “Fasten your seatbelts: It’s just the beginning.”\n\nEven though the term “sharing” was quickly being drained of any meaning, industry insiders still touted its social benefits. In 2014, Airbnb global head of community Douglas Atkin told a sharing economy conference , “The sharing economy deserves to succeed. There’s a decentralization of wealth and control and power. That’s why this economy is a better economy.”\n\nBy the mid-2010s, the narrative around the innovative, cure-all sharing economy had started to sour. As platforms banking on “collaborative consumption” edged toward multibillion-dollar valuations, sharing began to feel naive.\n\n“I sort of observed the shift happening beginning in 2016,” says labor attorney Veena Dubal, who was working with freelance taxi drivers in San Francisco before sharing hit the road. “There was a moment of novelty but then a realization that these were the same things. Just much cheaper and unregulated.”\n\nThree years ago, in a piece co-authored with entrepreneur and model Lily Cole , Adam Werbach also suggested that corporations  had hijacked sharing. “Whilst modern rental platforms offer enormous value… they do not reflect the sentiment of sharing that has defined communities as communities for thousands of years.” They offered another word instead: rent.\n\n&gt; What came next wasn’t sharing. Power and control wasn’t decentralized — it was even more concentrated in the hands of large and valuable platforms.\nIn some instances, the sharing economy appeared to inflame the very problems it purported to solve. The supposed activation of underutilized resources actually led to more, if slightly different, patterns of resource consumption. A number of studies have shown that the ease and subsidized low cost  of Uber and Lyft rides are increasing traffic  in cities  and apparently pulls passengers  away from an actual form of sharing: public transportation. Students at UCLA are reportedly taking roughly 11,000 rides  each week that never even leave campus. In putting more cars on the road, ride-hail companies have encouraged would-be drivers to consume more by buying cars  with subprime loans  or renting  directly from the platforms themselves.\n\nAlongside making it easy to rent out spare rooms, vacation rental platforms encouraged speculative real estate investment. Whole homes and apartment buildings are taken off the rental market to act as hotels, further  squeezing  housing  markets  in already unaffordable cities.\n\nEarly sharing champions were ultimately correct about technology enabling a shift away from an ownership society, but what came next wasn’t sharing. The rise of streaming services, subscription systems, and short-term rentals eclipsed the promise of nonmonetary resource sharing. The power and control wasn’t decentralized; it was even more concentrated in the hands of large and valuable platforms.\n\nWhy go through the trouble of swapping your own DVDs for a copy of Friends With Benefits, after all, when you can stream it through Amazon Prime Video for $2.99? The idea of paying for temporary access to albums rather than outright owning them may have been galling at first, but we’re increasingly comfortable with renting all our music, along with our software, and our books. Downloading and sharing the materials that live on these streamed resources is impossible, illegal, or both.\n\nThe new trust never materialized. Government regulation typically plays an important role in mediating consumer relationships with corporate firms and for good reason. Peer-to-peer platforms can make  discrimination  easier , and they often claimed limited or zero liability when things went wrong . New social media reputation tools couldn’t prevent inevitable problems, especially when sharing companies did not institute background checks for their freelance workers or inspect homes and vehicles for safety.\n\nSharing didn’t deliver broad financial stability either. The jobs eventually created by the sharing economy were poorly regulated and hastened the broader growth of contract labor, pushing down already low wages  for freelancers and employees alike. A few frequently quoted studies have claimed that soon, most of us will be freelancers . But most of that freelance work  appears to be extremely part-time and merely supplemental income, and ride-hail driver turnover  in particular is high.\n\nSharing doesn’t have the positive market power it wielded 10 years ago. Since 2016, tech entrepreneurs and their promoters in the press seem to have largely ditched the language of sharing. It’s now about “platforms,” “on-demand services,” or, most recently, “the gig economy.”\n\nLabor attorney Dubal is not thrilled with the new “gig” language either. The term may seem honest — it places the precarious nature of the contract labor front and center — but it doesn’t assuage broader structural concerns. “Even people who’ve stopped using the ‘sharing economy’ haven’t necessarily seen the light in terms of what kinds of work the company has propagated more broadly,” Dubal says. “They’ve normalized unregulated business.”\n\nSome of sharing’s earliest, most outspoken champions have distanced themselves from the term. Originally launched  in 2013 as  “a grassroots organization to support the sharing economy movement,” the nonprofit Peers purported to “grow, mainstream, and protect the sharing economy,” essentially acting as a corporate lobby firm for sharing, on-demand, and gig startups. Peers’ partners included Lyft, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Getaround, and dozens of other mostly for-profit companies. The organization said the bulk of its funding came from  “mission-aligned independent donors” and foundations, but it also had investment from Airbnb .\n\nBy 2016, Peers had pivoted to portable benefits — an infrastructure to sustain gig workers as they labored without an employment safety net. Peers became “an organization for people working in new ways,” and it merged with the newly created  Indy Worker Guild. Peers co-founder Natalie Foster  went on to co-found the Economic Security Project , which lobbies for a new solution to help struggling gig workers and job-havers alike: universal basic income.\n\n&gt; It’s now about “platforms,” “on-demand services,” or, most recently, “the gig economy.”\nIn 2018, April Rinne, who previously pushed the sharing economy’s promise of a “tighter social fabric,” acknowledged “the dark side”  of the sharing economy but wrote that “the challenges faced by the sharing economy today are largely a result of its success.” Rachel Botsman, who argued that sharing would allow us to trust one another again, now writes about how technology  and the concentration of power on large centralized platforms has led to “an erosion of trust.”\n\nThe demand for Botsman’s mythical community-shared power drill never seemed to materialize. Neighborly goods-sharing platforms Crowd Rent, ThingLoop, and SnapGoods are all many years dead, and meal-sharing Josephine ended long ago. CouchSurfing has gone for-profit, with venture capital investment.\n\nIt turns out sharing “is not really a mass-market idea, which is sort of depressing,” says Werbach, who’s pivoted Yerdle into a logistics firm for large brands interested in re-selling their used goods. “Kindergarten teachers are interested in that, but consumers are really interested in what’s in it for them.”\n\nSome of the early, true sharing believers have decamped for the growing platform cooperative movement. “Now there’s a whole consortium  of platform cooperatives,” says Orsi of the Sustainable Economies Law Center.\n\nAnd these companies don’t bank on sharing.

Many of us spend our days hopping between messaging apps, from iMessage to WhatsApp to Facebook Messenger to Instagram and back again, carrying on fractured conversations with the same set of people across a number of platforms.</p><p>But many of those services are owned by a single company: Facebook. WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/1/16959804/whatsapp-facebook-biggest-messenger-instagram-users">collectively reach more than 2 billion people</a>, making Facebook the owner of the world’s largest messaging platform — and a potential gold mine.</p><p>Facebook knows this, and sensing the opportunity to completely own modern messaging, reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger.html">plans to unify those messaging services into a single, connected platform</a>. This would bring an obvious benefit to users — convenience — but I’m not convinced that merging these platforms is really about users’ needs at all. In all likelihood, this is about Facebook knowing more about its users, regardless of where they’re chatting, for the sake of its ad business.</p><h4><strong>Removing Walls</strong></h4><p>You could imagine Facebook’s products today as a series of silos. Instagram and WhatsApp have their own databases and <a href="https://qz.com/1525661/your-digital-identity-has-three-layers-and-you-can-only-protect-one-of-them/">identity layers</a> separate from the core social network. Users must create a login for each distinct network, which creates a fresh “identity” in the respective app’s database–even if a user logs in to Instagram using the Facebook login feature, because each service uses its own separate database infrastructure. In other words, all of these platforms are effectively distinct from one another despite sharing some common functionality.</p><figure></figure><p>The problem with this is obvious: It’s difficult for Facebook to get a complete picture of your habits, who you talk to, and what you’re talking about. Facebook does correlate some data between the services — like phone numbers — but they remain largely siloed from one another.</p><p>That’s a problem for Facebook, because the company relies on advertising for almost all of its revenue. (Last week, Facebook <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2019/Q1/Q1-19-Press-Release.pdf">announced</a> that it had made a little more than $15 billion in the first three months of 2019 alone, almost all of which came from ads.) As people <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/private-messages-new-social-networks/">use the broader social network less, in favor of private messaging</a>, it’s harder for Facebook to understand their habits — particularly in the case of WhatsApp, which is currently encrypted and difficult to serve personalized ads on.</p><blockquote>A unified messaging platform would allow Facebook to paint a better picture of you, rather than forcing the company to tie together disconnected pieces of metadata.</blockquote><p>Facebook’s solution to this problem is likely to be unifying the identity layer across all of these apps — allowing WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger to recognize the one true “you” — and then creating common endpoints for the databases to connect with one another. Today, Facebook needs to correlate the data you provide to each app in order to target ads properly, which is prone to mistakes and inconsistency. Unifying this, and removing that process, would allow these apps to tap into one “ad profile” that understands everything about you, regardless of where that data actually lives. This would make it much easier for the company to data mine the people you interact with and general topics across conversations, regardless of where you’re having them, effectively building a mega-platform behind the scenes.</p><p>Thus, the unified messaging platform would allow Facebook to paint a better picture of you as a whole person, rather than forcing the company to tie together disconnected pieces of metadata like it does today. That’s incredibly appealing to advertisers, and exactly the kind of problem you need to solve when your model is suddenly pivoting from publicly shared data to private conversations.</p><p>It’s unlikely that Facebook will merge the messaging databases backing each app directly, largely because their feature sets are so varied. But by abstracting away the identity layer, the company would be able to keep better track of what you’re doing, even though your conversations would remain stored in separate databases.</p><figure></figure><p>The proposed changes would mean that the apps themselves become little more than brands you interact with. WhatsApp and Messenger might have distinct styles and icons, but beneath it all you’d really be interacting with one core service.</p><p>In that world, Facebook’s “product” would largely be an identity layer that happens to have a social network attached to it. And that identity layer would also be the unified lens that Facebook sees you through, providing the ability to serve relevant advertisements regardless of what app you’re interacting with.</p><h4><strong>Strange Messaging</strong></h4><p>It’s weird that Facebook would signal these changes so early. Merging the backends of these apps is a technical problem, and most companies would have quietly handled it in the background.</p><p>But Facebook might be worried about how this merger would be perceived. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/27/facebooks-plan-to-merge-messaging-services-ignites-antitrust-concerns.html">Regulators are already circling the social network</a> — and the notion of a unified messaging app isn’t exactly calming them down.
